| **✗** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Context

In Curaçao a _Leerplicht_ is in place :

> The Compulsory Education Ordinance and the Compulsory Education Ordinance Curaçao consist of a description of
> rules regarding the obligation of parents/guardians to:
>
> A. Enroll his/her child(ren) in a school;
>
> B. Ensure that the child attends all daily classes.

Curaçao Chronicles confirms that homeschooling is only possible in exeptional
cases :

> To qualify for an exemption, parents must demonstrate significant objections to the direction of all existing school organizations on the island. The evaluation showed that in recent years, parents have not sufficiently met this criterion. Most objections were related to the organization of education, not to its ideological direction.

> The number of exemption requests has increased over the past five years. This has led to stricter policies starting in the upcoming school year. Parents who receive a rejection will be required to comply and enroll their child in a school.
