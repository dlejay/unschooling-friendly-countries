# Unschooling in Afghanistan

## Compulsory education

Schooling is compulsory for 9 years for boys.

The current law also mandates 9 years for girls, but in practice it is only 6
years since girls cannot enter secondary education.

## Unschooling

Afghanistan is awaiting a new Constitution.
According to a report from Rahmatullah Amiri and Ashley Jacksonâ€¯:

> Ensuring all forms of education respect and adhere to Islam is a central principle.

## News

UNICEF and partners run Community-Based Education (CBE) classes that function like local schools. By early 2025, UNICEF reports such programs serve ~445,000 children (64% girls).
These classes are held in villages and neighborhoods (often covertly), effectively providing informal home- or community-schooling.
