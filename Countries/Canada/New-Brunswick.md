# Unschooling in New Brunswick

## Context

Homeschooling is explicitly legal in New Brunswick and operates under a notification-equivalent exemption regime.

According to the Department of Education :

>   **Applying for a Home School Exemption**
> 
> When choosing the home school option, the parent or guardian must obtain an official exemption from attending public school each year that the child is home schooled. The parent or guardian must complete an Annual Home Schooling Application Form each year and submit the completed form to the school district office. The form will be forwarded to the minister of education for review.

This procedure functions as administrative notification, not discretionary authorization.
There is no curriculum approval, inspection, or evaluative power attached to the exemption.

 
> **Planning the Home School Curriculum**
> 
> In order to be considered “effective instruction,” the home school curriculum must include these areas from the Public school curriculum:[…]

But :
- no curriculum is submitted or approved ;
- no monitoring or assessment exists ;
- no sanctions are defined.
  
Therefore there seems to be no enforced curriculum, despite the advisory language.
