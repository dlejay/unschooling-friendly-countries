# Unschooling in Manitoba

## Context

According the the Education Act,

> When notification to take place
> 260.1(2) The parent or guardian shall, in a form approved by the minister, notify the minister about the home school when it is first established and on or before September 1 in each year.

> 260.1(4) The parent or guardian shall provide the minister with periodic progress reports on each pupil in the home school. The reports must contain the information and be provided according to a schedule determined by the minister.

From the official website :

> When planning for homeschooling, parents must demonstrate how their educational programming is equivalent to that of a public school.

In practice, no curriculum, testing, or inspections are prescribed; the requirement is legal equivalency, not curricular conformity.
