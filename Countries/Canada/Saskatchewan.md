# Unschooling in Saskatchewan

## Context

According to responsiblehomeschooling.org :

> **Written notice of intent** to homeschool must be sent to either the board of education of the school division in which the child resides, or to the conseil scolaire. This entity is the “registering authority” Parents complete one Notification Form regardless of the number of children included in the home education plan. Each student will be registered individually by the registering authority. 
> 
> **Included with the notification form, the parent must submit a written Home Education Plan**. This plan must follow the Goals of Education for Saskatchewan, be age-appropriate, and account for the ability level of the student. The program should outline the philosophical approach and reasons for choosing home education. 

> Within 30 days of receiving the Notification Form, the registering authority will review the notification. If the notification is compliant with regulations, the registering authority will notify the parent of successful registration of the home-based education program.
