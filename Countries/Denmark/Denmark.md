# Unschooling in Metropolitan Denmark

## Context

From the Danish Constitution,

> Section 76 of the Constitution.
>
> All children of the educational age, are entitled to free primary school education. Parents or guardians, who themselves make sure that the children receive a course of education, that can be measured by what is usually required in primary and lower secondary schools, is not obliged to let the children be tought at primary school.

With the following comment from ft.dk,

> Education can take place at home or at a private school. But the education must be on a par with primary school education.

From Retsinformation.dk,

> According to Section 2 of the Free Schools Act, the language of instruction in a free primary school is Danish, unless the Minister of Education has approved another language of instruction. The provision does not exclude that teaching in a foreign language takes place in this language (e.g. that English is taught in English). English, German and French can also be taught in other subjects when this takes place in conjunction with the teaching of the language subject. Teaching in the subject Danish must always take place in Danish, regardless of whether the minister has approved another language of instruction, as the teaching must of course be organized according to the students' academic level. The crucial thing is that the students get a competence in the Danish subject that is on par with that of the primary school.
