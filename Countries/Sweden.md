## Compulsory education

Compulsory schooling (_skolplikt_) in Sweden encompasses a total of ten years.
This period of mandatory education is structured to begin at an early age and provide a comprehensive foundational education for all children residing in the country.

## Context

Homeschooling got outlawed by the *Skollag (2010:800)* :

> **Who are subject to compulsory schooling**
>
> § 2 Children who reside in Sweden are obliged to attend school according to the regulations in this chapter.

The landscape of homeschooling in Sweden, legally defined as ‘fulfilling compulsory schooling in another way’ (_att fullgöra skolplikten på annat sätt_),
remains characterized by its exceptional rarity and highly restrictive legal framework.
The Swedish Education Act (2010), effective since 2011, permits this alternative only under ‘extraordinary circumstances’ (_synnerliga skäl_),
a condition interpreted with such stringency that it effectively precludes homeschooling for most families, particularly those motivated by philosophical or religious reasons.
This legal position has remained unchanged since its implementation.
