# Unschooling in Sierra Leone

## Context

According to the Education Act 2004 :

> (4) A parent, including a guardian, who neglects to send his child to school for basic education commits an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding Le500,000.00 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both such fine and imprisonment.

but this section was removed in the Education Act 2023.
The only section that mentioned compulsory schooling in the new act is :

> **22** (2) Government shall support one year free compulsory pre-school education, when a child reaches the age of 5 years.

it then seems that schooling is no longer compulsory in Sierra Leon.
