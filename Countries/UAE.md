## Compulsory education

Under the Federal Law N°39 of 2022, education is compulsory for Emirati
citizens from primary level (around age 6) until the end of secondary school
(roughly age 18).

For non-citizens (expatriate residents),
schooling is only legally compulsory until the end of the primary stage

## Unschooling

Alongside the compulsory education law,
the MoE provides a formal “home-study” or homeschooling stream as part
of its Continuing Education programs.
This stream is available for students in Grades 7–12 who exceed the typical age for their grade level.
(For example, Grade 7 applicants must be at least 14 years old, about two years older than the standard age for that grade).
This program was established to accommodate students – both UAE nationals
and residents – who missed or left formal schooling and need an
alternative path to complete secondary education.
Enrolled home-study students receive the national curriculum (Arabic) textbooks and materials from the MoE and study independently.
They must sit for ministry-administered exams at the end of each semester
or year, and upon passing, earn certificates equivalent to regular
public school diplomas.

In the Emirate of Dubai,
homeschooling can also occur under the Knowledge and
Human Development Authority (KHDA)’s Rahhal program,
introduced as part of the Dubai Future Foundation’s 10X initiative.
Rahhal (Arabic for “traveler”) is a flexible schooling framework that
allows students enrolled in private schools to customize their learning,
including part-time schooling or alternative learning
experiences – effectively a hybrid model that can incorporate homeschooling.
However, Rahhal requires the child to remain registered in a
Dubai private school (the school must be a participating institution).

Outside of Dubai, other emirates do not have distinct homeschooling
initiatives like Rahhal,
but local education authorities generally defer to the federal MoE policies.
