| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✓** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Compulsory education

Serbian law mandates eight years of primary education for all children.
By constitution and law, elementary schooling is compulsory for eight grades,
typically covering ages roughly 7 through 14–15.

## Unschooling

Although homeschooling is legal in Serbia, by the Law on Primary Education :

> Article 38
>
> A parent or other legal representative has the right to enable his child to receive basic education and upbringing at home,
> while providing for the costs of education and upbringing.

it is in practice only allowed for children with disabilities or illnesses and homeschoolers must follow
the official curriculum.

Parents must inform the child’s school in writing before the start of the intended home‐school year (by the end of the previous school year) that they will provide home education.
No separate permit or registration with the state is prescribed beyond this notification.

Notably, a 2020 ministerial bylaw (Official Gazette 109/2020) imposes that a home‐schooled pupil may advance at most two grades per primary‐education cycle by exam, and to sit an exam the student must have formally covered at least two-thirds of the year’s instruction in each subject.
If a student fails an exam, they may retake it once ; failing twice generally
forces the student to return to regular schooling.

## News

By contrast with some Western countries, Serbia has not seen a post-2020 surge in homeschool enrollment.
