# Unschooling in Mexico

## Context

As explained by OLASE

> In Mexico, homeschooling and unschooling exist in a legal gray area that allows them to be practiced without any consequences but also without guarantees. It is considered a legal gray area because the way the laws are written allows families to educate at home without authorities being able to compel them otherwise, as there is no explicit prohibition against homeschooling.
>
> To understand this better, it is necessary to recognize that the entire Mexican education system is regulated by Article 3 of the Constitution. This article establishes that the government is responsible for education and that schooling from basic levels to university is mandatory. This could be interpreted as an obligation for Mexican parents to send their children to school, but that is not the case; in reality, the obligation falls on the state. In Mexico, the government is required to provide education to any citizen who requests it, and this education must be secular and free. Since Article 3 only states that education is mandatory, parents who choose to educate their children at home can feel reassured that they are fulfilling their duty to educate, meaning they cannot be prosecuted or forced to enroll their children in school.
>
> On the other hand, parents are responsible for ensuring their children’s right to education, a right established in the General Law on the Rights of Children and Adolescents. This law clearly states that all minors have the right to receive an education. Since homeschooling seeks to provide education tailored to children’s needs, this right is preserved, and therefore, no law is being violated.
>
> Finally, Article 31 of the Constitution states that it is the responsibility of all Mexicans to ensure their children attend school. This could potentially be used to mandate school enrollment, but in practice, it is not enforced for two reasons. First, there is no penalty for failing to meet this responsibility. Second, the Mexican government lacks the capacity to provide a nationwide quality education system that meets the very standards it has set in Article 3. As a result, homeschooling parents can argue that until those conditions are met, their children will continue to receive education at home. However, no such case has ever been brought before the courts.
