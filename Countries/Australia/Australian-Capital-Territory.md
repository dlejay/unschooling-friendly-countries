# Unschooling in the Australian Capital Territory

## Compulsory education

Education is compulsory for children from 6 to 17 years of age, or until they complete Year 12, whichever comes first.
Parents must either enrol their child in a registered school or obtain approval for home education.

## Unschooling

Home education is lawful in the ACT but requires registration and prior authorization
from the Director-General of the Education Directorate.  
Parents must submit an education plan demonstrating how a high-quality education will be provided.  
Once approved, the registration must be renewed periodically,
with progress reports or evidence of learning supplied to the Directorate.  

The law allows flexibility in educational methods : parents are not required to follow the Australian Curriculum,
provided the child receives a broad and suitable education.
