# Unschooling in Tasmania

## Compulsory education

Education is compulsory for all children from age 5 to 17 in Tasmania.
Students must remain in education or training until they finish Year 12
(or a Certificate III) or turn 18.

## Unschooling

Tasmania does not allow curriculum-free education.

Home educators must submit a Home Education Summary and Program (HESP) describing how they will meet the 10 Standards listed in the Education Regulations 2017 (literacy, numeracy, ICT, physical development, personal and social capabilities, etc.).

A registration officer reviews each HESP and visits the home to verify that the child’s education satisfies the standards.
Renewal is required every year, and progress is monitored through reports and follow-up visits.

According to the FAQ :

> **What are Standards?**
> 
> Standards are ten areas home educators are required to address,
> they are located in the Education Regulations 2017 and must be addressed in a home education application.

and according to the Education Act :

> 
> (1) A parent who intends to home educate his or her child may apply for approval of a proposed home education program that is to be provided to the child by that parent during the period of one year specified in the application.
