| **✗** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Compulsory education

Children are generally required to attend school through at least the secondary level.

## Unschooling

According to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ministry of National Education,

> It is compulsory for every citizen of compulsory education age to attend a school.

The Turkish Cypriot system closely mirrors Turkey’s education policy, which mandates school attendance and provides no exceptions for home education.
