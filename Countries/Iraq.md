# Unschooling in Iraq

## Compulsory schooling

According to the Compulsory Education Law No. (118) of 1976

> The child's guardian is obligated to enroll him in primary schools,
> when he completes the age stipulated in the above paragraph and continues there,
> until the child completes the primary school stage, or fifteen years of age.
> Guardian means the child for the purposes of this law who is actually responsible for his care.

The Kurdistan Region is even stricter, having extended compulsory education to 9 years
(up to age 15-16) and introduced fines for parents who fail to enroll their children in school.
