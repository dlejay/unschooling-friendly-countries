| **✗** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Compulsory education

Since Royal Decree 31/2023, Oman mandates about 10–11 years of education for every child.
This covers the entire primary and lower secondary level.

## Unschooling

Since Royal Decree 31/2023, the newly enacted School Education Law (May 2023) permits home study (i.e. homeschooling or distance learning)—but only when the Ministry of Education grants approval based on special circumstances such as serious illness, remote living conditions, or other valid reasons preventing regular school attendance.

Parents who do not enroll or ensure attendance can face criminal penalties (1–3
months imprisonment and/or a fine of 500–1000 OMR), unless the Ministry grants
an exemption for home study.
