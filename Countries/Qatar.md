# Unschooling in Qatar

## Compulsory schooling

Homeschooling is only allowed in exceptional cases.
Article 8 of the Mandatory Education Law states :

> Any child who develops an illness or disability that prevents him or her from attending public or private schools is excused from mandatory education for the period of such illness or disability in accordance with a decision from the Minister based on a certificate of a Competent Medical Authority at the Higher Council of Health. This exemption also applies to any child suspended from school due to temporary circumstances. Exemption from mandatory school attendance shall cease when such illness, disability or temporary circumstance no longer affects the child.
>

Since 2023, expatriate families must also show proof of school enrollment
to renew their children’s residence permits.
