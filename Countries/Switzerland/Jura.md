| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Compulsory education

Jura’s compulsory schooling (_scolarité obligatoire_) runs 11 years (about age 4 through 14–15).

## Context

According to the *Loi sur l’enseignement privé* :

> **Art. 9** Parents or legal guardians who intend to give private instruction to children of compulsory school age,
> or to have them given private instruction, shall notify in writing the school board of the level concerned in the child's usual place of residence.
> This notice shall indicate the persons responsible for the instruction and the measures taken to ensure that the child receives instruction
> that meets the general requirements of the plans of study.
> The notice must be renewed at the beginning of each year and whenever the child's place of residence changes.

## News

In 2024 Jura’s government and parliament proposed and began enacting much stricter rules.
A cantonal bill (revision of the private-education law) was submitted in January 2024 and approved in first reading
by the parliament in September 2024.
The new provisions (effective August 2025) include the following changes :

- Authorization regime : Homeschooling will require formal authorization from the _Service de l’Enseignement_, replacing the old simple notification.
  Families must submit a written application (with curriculum and schedule) by May 31 for the next school year.
  Once granted, the authorization will be valid indefinitely – no annual renewal will be needed (unlike the former rule of yearly renewal).
- Timing : Home instruction can only begin at the start of the school year (after summer vacation); mid-year switches are no longer permitted ￼. Late requests may be considered only for exceptional reasons.
- Instructor qualifications : The person giving instruction must hold a recognized tertiary-level or pedagogical qualification (e.g. a degree or diploma from a 3-year professional training). (Previously, no specific credential was required.) Debate text specifies that each homeschooling parent should be guided by an external “référent pédagogique” with appropriate teaching credentials ￼.
- Language and modality : Instruction must be in French, reflecting Jura’s official language, and online-only schooling is explicitly forbidden.
  This is a new restriction intended to ensure consistency with the cantonal curriculum.
- Oversight : The _Service de l’Enseignement_ will have authority to monitor quality and reintegrate students into public school if standards are not met. Existing practice already re-enrolled a few students each year (5 in 2023, 3 in 2022) whose homeschooling was deemed inadequate. Under the reform, inspectors will continue annual or periodic reviews of homeschooled students.
