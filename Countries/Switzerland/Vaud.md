| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✓** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Compulsory education

Mandatory schooling (_école obligatoire_) in Vaud begins at age 4 and lasts 11 years.

## Unschooling

In Vaud, homeschoolers must follow the official curriculum (_Plan d’étude roman_).
The _Loi sur l'enseignement privé_ states :

> Art. 9 Home education
>
> 1. Every person who undertakes to teach at home shall notify the municipality at the beginning of each school year of the list
>    of his or her pupils.
> 2. This list shall be sent to the department, which shall check, if necessary by means of examinations,
>    that the requirements of the official curricula have been met.

Under current law (LOI du 7 juin 2011 sur l’enseignement obligatoire, LEO), parents only need to notify their local school in writing that they will homeschool.
The school then informs the cantonal education department (DGEO), and a pedagogical officer visits the child at least once a year to verify progress
(including via compulsory Canton-wide tests in French, German and math).

## Statistics

| School year | Homeschoolers |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 2013        | 220           |
| 2023        | 960           |

## News

In 2023–2024 Vaud undertook a major overhaul of its 1984 Private Education Law (LEPr) to more tightly regulate homeschooling.
In January 2023, after a tragic Montreux case involving unschooled children, the new Education Director announced a draft reform.
By July 2024 the cantonal government published a projet de loi (20_LEG_73) revising the LEPr.
This draft law would replace the old declarative regime with a permit system for homeschooling.
Key proposed changes include :

- Authorization Required: Parents must obtain formal approval from the DGEO before withdrawing a child from public school or choosing to homeschool from school-start.
  Emergency approvals may be granted mid-year only for special cases (e.g. moving into Vaud, long-term travel, serious illness).
  Renewals would be annual (no longer automatic).
- Qualifications for Tutors : The person providing most instruction must live in Switzerland and have at least a Swiss Secondary II diploma (CFC or equivalent).
  (The draft allows some grandfathering : parents already homeschooling at least three years could teach their own children without the diploma until the end of their education.).
- Curriculum Oversight : Parents must submit a detailed teaching program in advance, aligned with the official _Plan d’études romand_ (PER) objectives.
  Instruction must include French (at least as a second language) and provide socialization activities. Adaptations for special needs are allowed but must be validated by the authorities.
- Abolition of Old Rules : The existing ordinance on homeschooling (RLEO Art. 40) would be repealed, folding all rules into the new LEPr.
  The 6-child limit remains, and all applications in process when the new law takes effect would be evaluated under the old law.

After consultation, the Council of State approved the draft in late 2024 and sent it to the Grand Conseil (parliament) for debate.
Cantonal spokesmen confirmed the bill ‘will be on the government agenda in the coming weeks’ and then submitted to parliament.
If adopted, it would take effect in an upcoming school year (likely 2025/26).
