## News

In March 2023 the Canton of Schaffhausen revised its school law to tightly restrict homeschooling.
By referendum the electorate approved (60.1 % Yes) a change requiring any parent tutoring their own children at home to hold a recognized teaching diploma.
This new rule took effect in the 2023/24 school year.
An explicit exception allows each family to teach their children privately for up to two six-month periods without a diploma, but beyond that a qualified teacher is needed.
