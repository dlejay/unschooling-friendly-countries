| **✗** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Context

Homeschooling is not allowed in Ticino. Article 6 of the _Legge della scuola_ states that :

> All persons residing in the canton between the ages of four and fifteen are required to attend compulsory schooling.

## News

In 2023, a new law regarding compulsory schooling was discussed and then
abandonned. This proposal did not aim at legalizing homeschooling.
