## News

Local media have covered the slow emergence of homeschooling in SG.
A Tagblatt feature (Apr. 2025) describes how SG approved its first home-schooling requests in late 2022
and that the number of children taught at home has since grown (especially in the Toggenburg region).
The article emphasizes that the Education Council approves only those cases meeting the 65–70 %
group-instruction rule.
Earlier coverage (2022) noted that three SG families prevailed in administrative court – the court found
that the canton could not outright ban homeschooling and must justify denials.
In 2023 one SG family won an appeal forcing the council to re-evaluate its case ;
after revising their request to meet the group‐instruction criteria, the application was ultimately approved.
Likewise, two families whose original applications had been rejected resubmitted under the 2022 concept
and received approval.
To date there are no new published Cantonal Court verdicts on SG homeschooling
beyond these administrative decisions, but SG parents remain ready to litigate denials.
