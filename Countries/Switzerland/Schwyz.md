## Compulsory education

In Canton Schwyz, the mandatory duration of schooling (_Schulpflicht_) spans nine years of formal primary and lower secondary education.
Preceding entry into the first primary grade, attendance at one year of Kindergarten is also compulsory.
Therefore, the total period of mandatory education effectively covers ten years (1 year Kindergarten + 9 years school).

## News

In December 2024 the Schwyz Education Council (_Erziehungsrat_) approved major new regulations for private schooling (including homeschooling).
The official press release (announced Jan 2025) states that henceforth homeschooling will be allowed only for a child’s own siblings or other members
of the same household.
Further changes include : all private instruction must last at least six months ; approvals will only be issued on the fixed date of the school-year start
(1 August) ; and each school stage must be taught by at least one appropriately trained teacher.
These new rules (effective for the 2025/26 school year) significantly tighten previous practice.
For example, the long-standing requirement that tutors be formally credentialed has been enforced more strictly :
every grade must now have a properly qualified teacher on staff.
