## Compulsory education

The Canton of Neuchâtel mandates 11 years of formal schooling.
Article 2 of the canton’s school law explicitly states that ‘_la scolarité obligatoire comprend onze années complètes d’études_’.

## Status of unschooling

According to the *Loi sur l'organisation scolaire* :

> **Art. 7a**
>
> 1. Home education of a child by a parent, a governess, or a tutor is subject to the authorization of the municipal or inter-municipal school authority of the school district where the child resides. The authority must notify the cantonal office in charge of compulsory education.
> 2. Authorization is granted for one school year and may be renewed.
> 3. Only children who share the same legal residence may be homeschooled together.
> 4. Authorization may be limited, subject to conditions and obligations, or revoked at any time if any of the granting conditions are no longer met.
> 5. Home education is subject to supervision by the cantonal office in charge of compulsory education.
> 6. Through regular monitoring, the cantonal office verifies that the following cumulative conditions are met:
>    a) The child has a valid residence in the canton of Neuchâtel;
>    b) Teaching and upbringing respect the child’s fundamental rights;
>    c) The proposed educational plan is coherent and enables achievement of the learning objectives set by the current curriculum, and the time dedicated to the child’s education is sufficient to ensure full and effective implementation of the proposed program;
>    d) Adequate socialization measures are in place to ensure the development of social skills as required by the current curriculum.

## Trend

In 2024 the Neuchâtel Parliament (Grand Conseil) enacted a major reform of the school law to replace the declaration regime with an authorization requirement.
The Loi sur l’organisation scolaire (LOS, RSN 410.10) and Loi concernant les autorités scolaires (LAS, RSN 410.23) were amended by law of 5 November 2024 (FO 2024 N°47) to take effect 1 January 2025.
Under the new Article 7a LOS, ‘_La scolarisation à domicile … est soumise à l’autorisation de l’autorité scolaire communale [ou intercommunale] du cercle scolaire de la commune qu’il habite_’.
