## News

In 2023 the Obwalden government began a comprehensive revision of its Education Act (“Bildungsgesetz”). A public consultation (Vernehmlassung) was held, with 24 respondents including municipalities, parties, teacher unions and associations – and at least one homeschooling family (“Kayser”).
The draft bill included a reworked Article 40 on Privatunterricht.
In their submission, the Kayser family warned that the new wording would
‘contradict the cantonal constitution’, since Art. 28 explicitly allows parents to teach their children at home.

In summary, the draft law would codify a de facto ban on homeschooling in Obwalden, permitting it only in very exceptional cases via a controlled approval process.
Cantonal officials have publicly framed these changes as necessary to ensure educational quality. The Education Department report emphasizes that homeschooling requests have ‘risen’ in recent years, but insists the default policy must remain school attendance.
