| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Compulsory education

Education in Glarus is obligatory for 11 years :
children who turn age 4 by July 31 begin school the following year, and must complete 11 years of schooling.

## Unschooling

Home education (‘_Privater Einzelunterricht_’) is legally allowed only by special permit.

According to the *Gesetz über Schule und Bildung* :

> If the legal guardians want their school-age children to be taught individually or to teach them themselves,
> they require permission from the department.

In practice the cantonal permit is granted only if the homeschooling parent holds a valid teaching diploma
and provides instruction equivalent to the public-school curriculum.
