| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Compulsory education

Compulsory schooling in Geneva spans 11 full years.

## Current status of unschooling

According to the *Loi sur l’instruction publique* :

> **Art. 9 Principle(43)**
>
> All children living in the canton of Geneva must receive, in public or private schools, or at home,
> an education in conformity with the prescriptions of the present law and the general program established by the department.

In principle in Geneva, homeschooling is “declarative” and there are no requirements.
But in facts, the authorities deliver “authorisations” for one year and require that the parents have at least a _diplôme de maturité_.

Geneva’s schooling rules apply equally to Swiss and foreign residents.

## Trend

One notable development is jurisprudential :
in September 2024 the Geneva Administrative Court upheld a parent’s right to homeschool without onerous extra conditions.
In that case, the DIP had initially imposed additional requirements (e.g. compulsory English tests and projects)
on a home-schooled student.
The court struck down these additions, ordering that the child’s homeschooling plan be accepted
‘_sans exigence supplémentaire_‘ (without extra requirements).
