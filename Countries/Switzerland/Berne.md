## Compulsory education

Education is compulsory for 11 years in Canton Bern.
This mandatory schooling period, known as the _obligatorische Volksschule_, usually spans ages 4 to 15.
It comprises three cycles: two years of kindergarten (Cycle 1, years 1–2), six years of primary school (Cycle 1 continued through Cycle 2, years 3–8), and three years of lower secondary school (Cycle 3, years 9–11).

> or have them instructed privately must obtain authorization from the appropriate department of the Department of Public Instruction.

Expatriates or foreign nationals living in Bern are generally subject to the same homeschooling rules as Swiss citizens in the canton – there are no special exemptions for non-citizens.
The instruction must follow the Bernese curriculum and be delivered in the official language of the region (German in most of Bern, or French in Bern’s francophone districts).

Bern’s School Inspectorate has also stepped up oversight (‘reinforced its controls’).
