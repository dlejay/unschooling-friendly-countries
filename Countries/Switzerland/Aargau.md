## Unschooling

According to the official website of the canton of Aargau :

> Private training
> Compulsory schooling can also be fulfilled as part of private training.
> The private schooling of school-age children by parents, foster parents or a third party must be reported to the responsible school management.
> The holders of parental authority have to ensure that their children receive sufficient education.
>
> The private training is under state supervision.
> The start and end of a private course must be reported to the school management at least 14 days in advance,
> based on the ordinance on the elementary school. As a rule, private training can only be started at the beginning of the semester.
> The school management asks the parents to provide evidence of sufficient instruction
> (regular, structured instruction, adherence to the curriculum, proof of achievement by the children, etc.).
> The school management is obliged to report to the Department of Education, Culture and Sport (BKS).
> Adequate teaching is checked regularly by the school supervisory board in consultation with the school management on site.

By law, home-schooled children must be prepared so that re-entry to the public schools is always possible.
Practically, this means that the school monitors whether the pupil’s language, mathematics, science and social skills match the expected grade level.

Swiss and cantonal schooling rules apply equally to all residents.
