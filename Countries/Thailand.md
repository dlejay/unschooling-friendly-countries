## Compulsory education

For Thai people,
Thailand’s 2017 constitution guarantees “basic education not less than twelve years” free of charge.
In practice, the current National Education Act B.E. 2542 (1999, amended) requires nine years of compulsory schooling
(Grades 1–9 : six years primary + three years lower secondary).

## Homeschooling

A 2004 ministerial regulation explicitly grants families the right to provide basic education at home,
on the condition that parents register with their local education office and submit annual learning plans for their children.
Under that rule, parents must apply to the district (obtain permission) and students must undergo periodic assessment.

## News

In March 2023 Thailand enacted a new Learning Promotion Act (B.E. 2566), which overhauled non-formal and alternative education.
This law created a Department of Learning Promotion and repealed the old Non-Formal and Informal Education Act (2008).
It aims to cover ‘all forms of education’ across all ages (including family-based and informal learning),
though formal schooling (and its compulsory segment) remains governed by the 1999 Education Act.
As of 2023–24, implementing regulations under the new law are still being developed.

Notably, in 2024 the Office of the Basic Education Commission (OBEC) issued a new Home-Schooling Guide (แนวทางการจัดการศึกษาขั้นพื้นฐานโดยครอบครัว) that took effect on 16 May 2024.
Under the guide, families must align their educational plans closely with the national core curriculum, set formal class schedules, and ensure features like a ‘study corner’ at home.
Critically, some districts began enforcing compulsory-school rules on home learners: requiring fixed hours, adherence to all eight core subjects’ standards, and even formal testing in each subject

Following the outcry, OBEC held meetings with home-school representatives.
As of May 2024, OBEC agreed to review the new guidelines.
The Ministry confirmed it would form a working group to address the complaints and, in the meantime, told districts to continue using the previous home-school manual so that children already enrolled would not be forced out of education
