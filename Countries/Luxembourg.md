## Context

Article 21 of the Act of 6 February 2009 states that:

> Parents who intend to homeschool their child must explain their motives in their application
> and request authorization from the school district inspector. Such authorisation may be limited in time.
> Homeschooling must be aimed at acquiring the skill bases defined by the study plan.

## News

In 2023, the age of compulsory education was raised from 16 to 18 years old.

Since 2024, a bill is being discussed to strengthen controls and unify the law
on children older than 12 years old.

According to the numbers presented by the _Ministère de l’Éducation nationale_,
there were 208 children authorised to be homeschooled in 2023.
