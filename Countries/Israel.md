## Compulsory education

Education is compulsory for children from age 3 up to about age 15 (through 10th
grade) under the law.

## Unschooling

Homeschooling in Israel is heavily regulated by the Ministry of Education.
Parents must apply each year for a one-year exemption from compulsory
schooling.
They must submit a formal written application for home education to the Ministry of Education (through the Parent Portal)
and copy their local municipal education department.

A cornerstone of the application is a comprehensive educational plan prepared by the parents.
The parents must write a document explaining their educational philosophy – i.e. the rationale
and outlook that lead them to choose homeschooling.

Israel’s homeschooling rules apply equally to citizens and non-citizens who reside in the country.
