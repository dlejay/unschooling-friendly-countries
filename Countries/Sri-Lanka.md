| **âœ—** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Compulsory education

Education is compulsory from age 5 up to 16 years.

## Unschooling

Parents who fail to send their children to school will be guilty of an offence.
Since 2023, the Sri Lankan government has taken a stronger stance on enforcing compulsory education.
Top officials have made clear public statements that truancy and non-enrollment will not be tolerated.

Foreign nationals residing in Sri Lanka face the same local education laws for
their school-age children.
