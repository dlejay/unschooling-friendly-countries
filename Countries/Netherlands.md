| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✓** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Context

The Leerplichtwet of 1969, states

> **Artikel 2. Verantwoordelijke personen**
>
> **1** Anyone who has legal authority over a minor, as well as anyone who is actually responsible for the care of the minor, is required under the provisions of this law to ensure that the minor is enrolled as a pupil at a school and regularly attends that school after enrollment. Upon enrollment, an official government-issued document must be submitted, indicating the minor’s surname, initials, date of birth, gender, and citizen service number (BSN). If a BSN is not available, the student’s education number must be submitted if possible. If the persons referred to in the first sentence demonstrate at the time of enrollment that they are unable to provide either the BSN or the education number of the minor, they must submit it to the school as soon as they obtain it.

Homeschooling is only possible via an exemption.

## News

August 2024. The Hinrichs family received a favourable court ruling. They can now
homeschool with a religious exemption.
