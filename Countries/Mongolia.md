# Unschooling in Mongolia

## Compulsory education

Mongolia’s compulsory education spans the full pre‑university cycle.
By law, “compulsory education” means the 12‑year schooling level.

## Unschooling

The new school law of July 2023 reads :

> 22.7.At the request of parents, guardians and custodians, primary education can be taught through home education, and the procedure for organizing and supervising home education shall be approved by the Cabinet member in charge of education matters.
