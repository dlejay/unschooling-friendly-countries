## Unschooling

According to the Policy Directive and Procedures on home education :

> 1.1. Policy Statement
> Guernsey law places a legal duty on parents/carers to cause their children of compulsory
> school age (i.e. 5 to 16 years) to receive 'efficient, full-time education suitable to the child’s
> age, ability and aptitude and to any special educational needs he may have either by regular
> attendance at school or otherwise'

> 2.2 School Roll
> Children of compulsory school age must stay on the school roll and attend full time until
> Education Services has approved the intended home education provision.

> 2.3.2 Evidence for an Efficient and Suitable Education
> Discussion with both the parent and child is valuable in considering home education
> requests. Where a child attends school, discussion to include them will be scheduled for
> outside of normal school hours, to avoid them needing to miss any schooling for the
> purpose.
> The EDO should expect to find evidence of serious intent by the parents/carers to educate
> the child, and evidence of an approach to education that is consistent with their values and
> educational aims and with their understanding of how the child learns effectively. The
> evidence should convince a reasonable person that, if the arrangement was approved, the
> child would receive efficient full time education suitable to his or her age, ability, aptitude
> and to any special needs they might have. […]
