## Context

Education is a transferred service under the 1948 Agreement,
so Guernsey’s laws apply in Alderney.

The islands of Herm and Jethou are administered as part of Guernsey,  
so the same education law and policies apply there.

## Compulsory education

Across the whole Bailiwick (Guernsey, Herm, Jethou, Alderney, Sark)  
compulsory education runs from age 5 to 16.  
Sark aligned with this age range in 2018; previously it ended earlier.
