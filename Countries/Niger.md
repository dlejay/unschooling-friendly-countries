# Unschooling in Niger

## Right to education

According to the 1998 _Loi d’Orientation du Système Éducatif_ (LOSEN),
education is recognised as a right and the State must guarantee access to
schooling for children aged 4 to 18.

The law contains no provision that makes education of shcooling compulsory.
