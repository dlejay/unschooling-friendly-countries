## Context

According to the 学校教育法 :

> Article 17 A guardian shall be obligated to have his/her child attend elementary school, the first semester of a compulsory education school, or the elementary department of a special-needs school from the beginning of the first school year on and after the day following the day on which the child reaches the age of six years until the end of the school year that includes the day on which the child reaches the age of twelve years.

But since 2019, the MEXT has now set up guidelines on how to implement
homeschooling making it equivalent
to school attendance:

> To utilize the attendance handling system, the following 7 requirements must be fulfilled:
>
> - A sufficiently close relationship between parents and the school.
> - Learning activities provided through the use of technologies such as IT.
> - Adequate face-to-face guidance.
> - A well-planned learning program based on understanding.
> - The principal having a comprehensive understanding of face-to-face guidance and learning activities.
> - Learning activities conducted when consultation or guidance is not possible in external institutions or facilities.
> - Evaluation of learning activities based on the school's educational curriculum.
