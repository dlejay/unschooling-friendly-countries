## Compulsory education

The Universal Basic Education (UBE) Act of 2004 requires parents to ensure their children complete basic education
– defined as six years of primary school and three years of junior secondary school (roughly ages 6–15).

## Unschooling

Education in Nigeria is partly decentralized, but no state to date has an independent law explicitly governing homeschooling.

## News

In mid-2025, the Federal Government took a notable step by launching a National Policy on Non-State Education,
which for the first time includes homeschooling setups under regulatory oversight.
This new policy – part of President Tinubu’s National Education Sector Renewal Initiative – aims to set standards for “non-state” schools
(i.e. education outside government schools, including private, faith-based, community schools and homeschooling).
According to the Minister of Education, the framework will introduce clear guidelines on infrastructure, curriculum delivery,
teacher qualifications, and quality assurance even for homeschooling arrangements.
