# Unschooling in Singapore

## Compuslory education

Singapore mandates six years of primary education for all Singaporean citizens.
Under the Compulsory Education Act (in force since 2003),
children above 6 and below 15 years old must attend a national primary school,
unless they receive an official exemption.

## Unschooling

Citizens must attend school, unless they get granted permissions by the MOE.

## Statistics

Homeschooling is extremely rare in Singapore.
Since compulsory primary education began in 2003, the number of Singaporean children approved for home education has been
“small and generally constant, at an average of about 50 Singaporean children for each primary age cohort every year”.
