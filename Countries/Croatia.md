## Compulsory education

In the Czech Republic, compulsory education lasts for a total of 10 years.

## Unschooling

The legal basis for individual education is § 41 of the Education Act.
This provision permits individual education for the entirety of compulsory school attendance, covering both the first stage (grades 1-5) and the second stage (grades 6-9) of basic school.
The law also extends this possibility to the mandatory year of preschool education.  

The process for obtaining permission is rigorous and centralized at the school level.
A parent or legal guardian must first enroll their child in a state-accredited “_kmenová škola_” (a guaranteeing or home-base school). They then submit a formal application to the director of this school, which must include several key components : 

A Statement of “Serious Reasons” (_závažné důvody_) : The law requires applicants to articulate the “serious reasons” for pursuing individual education. While the term is not explicitly defined, leaving its interpretation to the school director, common reasons cited by parents include pedagogical, health, or lifestyle factors.  

A Positive Assessment from a School Advisory Facility : A crucial and mandatory part of the application is a formal recommendation from a _pedagogicko-psychologická poradna_ (PPP), a pedagogical-psychological advisory center. This assessment evaluates the child’s suitability for this form of education.  

Proof of Educator’s Qualifications : The application must be accompanied by documentation proving the educational attainment of the person who will be providing the instruction (_vzdělavatel_).  

The final decision rests solely with the director of the _kmenová škola_.
This individual has the legal authority to either approve or deny the application, making them the ultimate gatekeeper for families wishing to pursue this path.
This concentration of power at the director level has led to an emergent phenomenon where certain schools become known as “homeschool-friendly”, attracting families from across the country who seek a supportive and experienced administrative partner.
This creates hubs of expertise but also concentrates the administrative burden on a relatively small number of institutions.

The Education Act specifies clear requirements for both the educator and the family.
The person formally responsible for the instruction must meet minimum educational standards :

- For the first stage (grades 1-5), the educator must have at least a secondary education completed with a matriculation exam (maturita).  

- For the second stage (grades 6-9), a university degree is required (a bachelor's degree is sufficient).  

A notable feature of the Czech system is the use of a “garant”.
If a parent does not personally meet these educational criteria, they can enlist another individual who does to act as a formal guarantor for the child’s education.
This guarantor provides their diploma for the application, while the parent often remains the primary day-to-day instructor.
This practice serves as a common and legally accepted workaround.
