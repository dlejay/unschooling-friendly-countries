| **âœ—** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Compulsory education

North Korea mandates 12 years of free, compulsory education for all citizens.

## Context

In North Korea, public education is mandatory, homeschooling is illegal for NK
citizens. This does not apply to foreigners.

## News

By 2024, the campaign against private tutoring had spread to other regions and
grown more punitive. In May 2024, Daily NK (a Seoul-based outlet with sources
inside North Korea) reported that a woman in Chongjin was sentenced to six
months in a disciplinary labor camp for tutoring three elementary school
students in her home.
