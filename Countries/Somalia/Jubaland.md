# Unschooling in Jubaland

Jubaland has not enacted a State Education Act or any other binding legal text establishing compulsory education.

Education is not compulsory at the federal level in Somalia ; the provisional constitution only establishes a right to education.
Idem for the draft interim charter of the state government of Jubaland.
