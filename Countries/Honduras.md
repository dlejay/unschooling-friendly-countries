## Compulsory education

Honduran law mandates free, compulsory education from early childhood through the end of secondary.
Specifically, the _Ley Fundamental_ and its _reglamentos_ require _educación gratuita y obligatoria_
from a year before pre-school through _Educación Media_.
In practice this means :

- _Prebásica_ (pre-primary): 3 years (ages 4–6) – by law the last year of prebásica is compulsory ;
- _Básica_ (primary): 9 years (ages 6–14) – explicitly “_gratuita y obligatoria_” ;
- _Media_ (secondary): 2–3 years (ages 15–17) – also compulsory.

## Unschooling

According to the _Lineamientos Educacion en Case_, homeschooling is a fundamental right in Honduras.
It also imposes very detailed guidelines on who can homeschool and how this should be done.
Approval is required before starting homeschooling.

If a child follows a foreign or international curriculum, it must be approved (“_avalado_”) by the _Secretaría de Educación_.
