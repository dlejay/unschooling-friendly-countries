## Compulsory education

Compulsory education in Grenada covers ages 5 through 17 inclusive.

## Context

According to the Education Act :

> (3) An educational plan for each student who is receiving home education shall be prepared and provided
> to the Chief Education Officer subject to the following conditions—
>
> (a) the initial educational plan shall be prepared and provided to the Chief Education Officer 3 months prior to the commencement
> of the home education programme;
>
> (b) the educational plan shall be for a minimum period of 3 school years and shall cover every year of the home education programme;
>
> (c) the educational plan shall include a description of the learning activities for the student that will comply with the goals
> and objectives set out in section 3(3); and
>
> (d) the educational plan shall be based on the national curriculum as established by the Minister under Part IX.

Foreign nationals living in Grenada are subject to the same rules.

## Trend

In mid-2024 the government amended the Education Act to extend compulsory
education from 5–16 years up to age 17 inclusive (effective September 2024).
