| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no prior authorisation         |

## Compulsory education

Taiwan currently has nine years of mandatory education for all children.

## Context

As noted by homeschool.tw :

> Parents should apply no later than April 30 or October 31 each year to the city or county government of their residence by submitting an application form and a proposal outlining the objectives, method, and content (curriculum, assessment, facilities, and equipment used) of the education, as well as the expected outcomes and background information of the people involved in the child's education.
>
> Parents may apply to do homeschooling for up to six years of elementary education, three years of junior secondary education, and three years of senior secondary education. The senior secondary education stage may be extended by two years if necessary.
>
> Applications are evaluated by the non-school education committee of each city or county, of which at least two fifths of the members must be non-school education parents or representatives of non-school education associations.

> Despite being homeschooled, elementary and junior secondary non-school students still need to be registered under a district school, which performs an administrative function. This includes accepting applications and issuing a graduation certificate once the non-school student has satisfied the graduation requirements as outlined in the application proposal and approved by the review committee.

As noted by tw.forumosa.com, Taiwan education laws only apply to citizens and do
not affect foreign children.

## Statistics

## News

In mid-2023, Taiwan enacted significant changes to its education laws to strengthen support for homeschooling (officially termed non-school-based experimental education).
On May 29, 2023, the Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Primary and Junior High School Education Act (國民教育法) that for the first time provides a legal basis for government subsidies to homeschooling families at the elementary and junior high levels.
The revised law explicitly states that,
“to assist the development of … school-based experimental education and non-school-based experimental education, the central competent authority shall formulate associated subsidy regulations”.
In practical terms, this means the Ministry of Education (MOE) must create guidelines and budget provisions to financially support K–9 students who are approved for homeschooling programs.
Prior to this change, only high school homeschoolers received government tuition subsidies (about NT$20,000–30,000 per year) under the 12-year Basic Education policy,
while younger homeschoolers were not subsidized.
The 2023 amendment “extends downward” the subsidies to cover compulsory education grades, aiming to make homeschooling more accessible to families of all socio-economic backgrounds.
(As of 2024, the MOE was still drafting the exact subsidy amounts and implementation details ; initial indications suggest a possible stipend on the order of a few thousand NT dollars per month per homeschooled child, comparable to existing support for special education homeschooling).
