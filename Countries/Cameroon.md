# Unschooling in Cameroon

## Context

Cameroonʼs education is administered as two parallel subsystems under
the same Ministry structures.
The Anglophone subsystem (used in Northwest and Southwest regions) is
modeled on the British system, while the Francophone subsystem
(in other regions) follows the French model.

Cameroonʼs dual system means families can choose English
or French curricula, but homeschooling regulations (or the lack thereof)
are the same across both subsystems.

## Compulsory education

The _Loi dʼorientation_ of 1998 states :

> **Article 9**
> Primary education is compulsory.

## Unschooling

The _Loi dʼorientation_ states :

> **Article 23**
>
> 1. Education is provided in the following schools : nursery schools ; primary schools ; general secondary schools and high schools ; technical or vocational secondary schools and high schools; post-primary schools ; teacher training colleges for general and technical education.
> 2. It may also be provided through a distance education system.

In practice, children got kidnapped for boycotting school.
Some children hide to homeschool.
