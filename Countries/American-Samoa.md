## Compulsory education

Education is compulsory from age 5 through age 18 (inclusive).

## Unschooling

In American Samoa, homeschools may operate under the private school statute.

Then,

> (b) No private school may operate without a certificate of authorization from the Department of Education, which shall be issued annually based upon the inspection of the school. No school which does not maintain satisfactory standards of instruction, curriculum, and physical plant as prescribed by the Director of Education may be issued a certificate.

> Children attending authorized private schools may not be required to attend public schools.

> Private school officials shall include in their curriculum such material as the Director of Education may require in the interest of good citizenship.

This applies to all residents.
