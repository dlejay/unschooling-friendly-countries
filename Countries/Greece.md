# Unschooling in Greece

| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Compulsory education

Attendance in an accredited school is legally compulsory for roughly 11 years
(from ages ~4–5 through 14–15).

## Unschooling

Article 2 of the _ΝΟΜΟΣ ΥΠ’ ΑΡΙΘ. 1566_ on the structure and function of primary and secondary education states :

> 3. Attendance is compulsory in elementary school and high school, as long as the student has not exceeded 16 years of age.
>    Anyone who has custody of a minor and fails to register or supervise their attendance is punished according to article 458 of the Criminal Code.

In mid-2024, a new education law (Law 5128/2024) introduced some adjustments to
these special provisions. Notably, it clarified that home teaching does not
always have to be delivered by a special-education teacher unless an official
assessment deems it necessary.
In other words, if a child is approved for home education due to health reasons, a regular teacher can be assigned except in cases where the state’s counseling center (ΚΕ.Δ.Α.Σ.Υ./KESY) recommends a specialized educator.
This tweak aimed to streamline home-schooling for special cases, addressing complaints that the previous rule
(requiring special-ed certified teachers in all cases) was too rigid.
Aside from such technical clarifications, however, the law did not expand the eligibility for homeschooling
— it remains off-limits unless those strict criteria are met.

## News

**Custody Case of a Homeschooling Mother:** In one widely reported case, child protective services intervened to remove an
8-year-old child from her mother’s care because the mother refused to enroll her
in school.
The mother – herself a teacher – believed the Greek school system was ‘second-rate’ and wanted to personally homeschool
her daughter to provide a more hands-on education.
Authorities deemed this unlawful.
The Athens prosecutor’s office warned that if the child was not registered in a school,
the mother would lose custody – and police would even be sent to take the child.
In this case, which garnered media attention, the mother was forced to comply under threat of legal action.
Her lawyer, along with the human rights group ‘Pleiades’, criticized the draconian approach
(no formal hearing was held before the removal order) and argued the mother was acting in the child’s best interest.
This incident – often cited by commentators – underscored the zero-tolerance enforcement of the anti-homeschool law.
It also prompted debate about parental rights: some observers sympathized with the mother’s desire for a better education, while others pointed out that Greek law leaves no room for personal choice in this matter.

**‘Palaiochristianos’ Case and Religious Motivations:** Greek media reported on a father in the Corinthia region (nicknamed the ‘palaiochristianós’, meaning ‘old-Christian’) who kept his children out of school, purportedly for religious reasons.
This ‘off-the-grid’ homeschooling by a devout family led to legal consequences – local authorities took strict action against the parents for violating compulsory education laws. The case highlighted that not only urban elites, but also rural or religiously conservative families, have attempted to defy the school mandate. The term ‘φτωχοδιάβολοι της Κορινθίας’ (‘poor devils of Corinthia’) was used in press commentary to describe this family, suggesting they faced severe punishment.
Their situation sparked discussion about whether the state’s firm stance was justified, and it drew attention to other families motivated by religious or ideological objections to the national curriculum.

**Revelations of Loopholes for Elite Families:** Perhaps the biggest debate in 2024 was ignited by the Union of Private School Teachers (ΟΙΕΛΕ), which made a shocking public complaint about clandestine homeschooling among affluent circles.
OIELE alleged that ‘around 200–300 children’ from wealthy families were essentially being homeschooled under the radar.
According to the union’s claims, these parents – including members of certain ultraconservative Christian sects and others distrustful of Greek schools – have been keeping their kids at home while technically circumventing the law by enrolling them in private schools that cooperate in name only.
In other words, some private schools allegedly helped these families by issuing paperwork and ‘attendance’ records for students who do not actually attend class, thus exploiting the system to give them the appearance of compliance.
OIELE’s president described this as an underground ‘homeschooling with the help of private schools’ scheme.
These revelations were accompanied by further allegations that certain private schools even issued fake certificates (‘μαϊμού τίτλους’) to cover for home-educated children.
The union urged the Ministry of Education to investigate and crack down on such practices.
