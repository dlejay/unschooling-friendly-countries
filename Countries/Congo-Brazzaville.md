According to the _Décret n° 2019-441 fixant les conditions d’organisation de l’enseignement dans la famille_

> Article 2 : Home education is intended to allow Congolese children temporarily living at home in foreign
> countries—where there are no Congolese consular schools or schools with a Francophone curriculum—to
> follow schooling similar to that provided to children in public and private schools in Congo,
> in order to acquire specific knowledge and skills.
>
> Home education also applies to Congolese or foreign children residing in areas of Congo
> that lack schools and teachers.
>
> Article 3 : Any child of compulsory school age, between 6 and 16 years old,
> residing in a foreign country without a Congolese consular school, may benefit from home education.

> However, Congolese children living on national territory are not concerned,
> except in localities entirely lacking schools—and only with the approval of the
> Minister of Education, following a substantiated opinion from the departmental prefect.

> Article 8 : The programs and educational content for home education are set by order of
> the Minister in charge of primary and secondary education.

> However, the teaching does not have to follow traditional methods of general education.
> The family is free to choose the means and methods to reach the expected level of these programs.
> This choice must first be submitted for review by the cultural advisor (for Congolese families abroad)
> or by the departmental director or a school inspector
> (for Congolese families in areas of Congo lacking schools and teachers).
