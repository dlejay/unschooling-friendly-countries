## Compulsory education

Education is compulsory from age 7 to age 18, since 2024
amendments to the Education Act, Basic Schools and Upper Secondary Schools Act,
and Vocational Education and Training Institutions Act.

## Unschooling

Since September 2024,
Estonia has begun a phased transition to make Estonian the sole language of instruction in general education,
with full implementation planned by 2030.

Homeschooling in Estonia is legal but tightly regulated : every homeschooled child must be registered with a local school,
follow the national curriculum, and pass bi-annual assessments by that school’s teachers.
