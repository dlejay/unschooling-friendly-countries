## Compulsory education

By statute, Jamaican parents must educate children within compulsory school age, defined by Ministerial order.
In practice, the government regards education as obligatory up to age 18.

## Unschooling

The Ministryʼs Independent Schools Unit (ISU) handles homeschool registration
and monitoring.
Parents must formally register each homeschooled child : in practice, one writes to the child’s school board to maintain the child’s enrolment, and submits a homeschool application to the ISU.
The ISU requires a detailed plan of study
(usually aligned with the National Curriculum) and conducts home inspections.
For example, MoEY guidelines note that the ISU “reviews and appraises”
all homeschool applications, “inspects home facilities and designated records”,
and may deregister any homeschool that fails to meet basic standards.
Homeschooled children are also expected to participate in national examinations
(e.g. Grade Six Achievement Test, CSEC) and extracurricular programs,
with attendance and evaluation records kept on file.

Approved homeschools must follow an “efficient and suitable” curriculum.
In practice, families use the Ministryʼs National Standards Curriculum
or an approved accredited alternative (several private curricula are allowed).
ISU guidelines require parents to keep regular attendance and evaluation logs,
and allow homeschooled children to sit public exams at the appropriate age.

After registration, the ISU conducts periodic inspections of the homeschool environment and records.
If a homeschool fails to meet standards, the ISU can revoke its approval.
Officials have warned that unregistered homeschools
(or those teaching more children than allowed) violate the law and can trigger intervention by child-protection authorities.

In addition, the Education Act and related laws impose a limit of six students per homeschool.
MoEYʼs homeschool policy states that a parent may not instruct more than six children in a home without special permission.
Likewise, under the Early Childhood Act, any person teaching three or more children under age six in a home must register as an early-childhood institution.
The ISU has reiterated that homeschooling parents are capped at six children.
All parents (citizens or non-citizens) must abide by these registration rules.

While not formally certified, parents are expected to be sufficiently educated.
Current MoEY policy suggests a parent should have at least two grade levels of education above the childʼs level ; in practice most homeschool parents hold college degrees.
