## Compulsory education

According to Bahrain’s Education Law N°27 of 2005

> Article Six
>
> Basic education is a right for children who reach the age of six at the beginning of the academic year, and the Kingdom is committed to providing it for them. Parents or guardians are obligated to implement this for a period of at least nine academic years. The Minister shall issue the necessary decisions to organize and implement this obligation for parents and guardians.

## Unschooling

The 2005 Education law states :

> Article Eight
>
> A fine not exceeding one hundred dinars shall be imposed on the parent of the child or the person in charge of him if he causes the child who has reached the compulsory age to fail to enroll in education, or to be absent from school without an acceptable excuse for a period of ten consecutive or non-consecutive days during the school year. Criminal proceedings shall not be initiated in either case except upon a request from the Ministry, and after it has warned the violator by a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt.

The law seems to apply to all children in the kingdom.
