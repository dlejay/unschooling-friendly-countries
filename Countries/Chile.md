| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✓** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Compulsory education

Chile mandates that children complete primary and secondary education as well as
one year of kindergarden, which together constitute 13 years of compulsory schooling.

## Unschooling

The Chilean Constitution states :

> **23** The right to education.
>
> **a** Education aims at the full development of the person at the various stages of his or her life, in the context of a free and democratic society, and should strengthen respect for fundamental rights and freedoms.
>
> **b** Families, through parents or, where appropriate, legal guardians, have the preferential right and duty to educate their children or wards, to choose the type of education and its educational establishment, as well as to determine their best interests. It shall be the responsibility of the State to grant special protection to the exercise of this right.
>
> **c** The State has the unavoidable duty to strengthen education at all levels and to encourage its continuous improvement, exercising tasks of promotion, regulation and supervision.
>
> **d** It is the duty of the State to promote preschool education, for which it shall finance and coordinate a free system from the lower nursery level, aimed at ensuring access to this and its higher levels. The second level of transition is compulsory, being a requirement for entry into basic education.
>
> **e** Basic and secondary education are compulsory, and the State must finance and coordinate a free system for this purpose, aimed at ensuring access for the entire population, guaranteeing funding per student in State and private establishments. In the case of secondary education, compulsory education shall extend until the age of twenty-one.

According to OLASE :

> Article 41 of the LGE, states that “A Supreme Decree issued by the Ministry of Education will regulate the way of validating knowledge developed outside the formal system, either from personal experience or the workplace, leading to levels or degrees, and how studies equivalent to primary or secondary education completed abroad will be validated.”
>
> The above law ensures that homeschooling is permitted in Chile. The validation process for studies achieved outside the formal system is fully regulated by Supreme Decree No 2272 of 2007, and can be carried out through two mechanisms: taking a validation test or undergoing a validation process.
>
> The validation test requires the submission of certain documents and the presentation of certificates of study that provide proof of completed courses leading to the level requested to be validated. The validation process requires a homeschooler to provisionally enroll in an educational institution designated by the Regional Ministerial Secretariat of Education where he/she is to be evaluated in order to obtain a qualification for determining his /her promotion or level.

For families who choose to homeschool, the primary **obligation** is to register the child for annual validation exams (_exámenes libres_) to certify each grade level of basic or secondary education.
These exams are authorized and supervised by the Ministry of Education (_Mineduc_) and are recognized as equivalent to attending school for the purposes of graduation, university admission, etc.

All children residing in Chile, regardless of nationality, are subject to the compulsory education laws.

## Statistics

| Year | Homeschoolers |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 2013 | 7,592         |
| 2023 | 33,331        |

For context, the total enrollment in Chile’s formal K-12 school system in 2023 was roughly 3.63 million students.
This means around 0.9 % (just under 1 %) of school-age children in Chile were being educated outside the formal system.

## News

**High Court Ruling on Homeschooling (2023)**: A landmark case in mid-2023
significantly bolstered the legal status of homeschooling. In July 2023, the
Court of Appeals of San Miguel (a Chilean appellate court) unanimously upheld a
family’s right to educate their son at home via a foreign distance-learning
program.
The case involved a Chilean student, José Antonio Widow, who
completed his high school education through a U.S.-based homeschool academy
(Marble Falls Academy, in conjunction with an Argentine program) while living in
Chile.
The Chilean Ministry of Education had refused to recognize his
homeschool diploma, thereby preventing him from applying to university.
The family filed a legal remedy (_recurso de protección_), arguing that their
constitutional freedom of education was violated. The Court agreed, ruling that
educational certificates earned through a foreign homeschooling program must be
recognized in Chile for all legal purposes.
In its decision, the court
explicitly affirmed parents’ rights to decide how to educate their children and
found the Ministry’s refusal to validate the studies to be an ‘arbitrary
discrimination’. The unanimous ruling ordered the Ministry to acknowledge the
student’s U.S. high school diploma.
This effectively legitimized his credentials
and allowed him to enroll in a Chilean university, which he did – he scored
highly on the university entrance exams (PAES) and by 2024 was in his second
year of law school at a top university.
