## Compulsory education

In Latvia, the law mandates two years of preschool education, plus nine years of
basic education.

## Unschooling

Homeschooling is only possible in exceptional cases.
According to the General Education Act:

> Article 20. 1 . Mandatory preparation of preschool children
>
> (1) Completion of the preschool education program is mandatory for children from the age of five.

## News

Latvia has enacted significant education reforms since 2023, including a phased transition to Latvian-only instruction in schools.
Amendments passed in 2022 mandate that from September 2023 onward, teaching in all public and private schools is gradually shifted to the state language (Latvian).
By September 2025, instruction at all levels (including previously bilingual programs) is conducted exclusively in Latvian.
Another major reform is the proposed elimination of distance learning (tālmācība) for compulsory basic education.
In 2024–2025, the Saeima (Parliament) considered amendments to the Education Law that would require all basic education (grades 1–9) to be delivered in-person,
discontinuing “extramural” and remote forms for those grades.
