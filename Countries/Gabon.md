## Compulsory education

Under the national education law and child protection code, schooling is
mandatory from age 5 up to 16 for any child residing in Gabon.

In addition, pre-schooling is mandatory from ages 0 to 5.

## Unschooling

> The 1991 Constitution, revised in 2011, recognizes the right of parents to choose the type of education they want to provide for their children, yet no additional regulations have been found regarding homeschooling specifically.

According to the _Loi organique 003/2018_,

> **Chapter II: Duties of the Child**
>
> **Article 64**: Every child has duties toward themselves, the family, the State, society, and the international community.
>
> Subject to the restrictions provided by current laws, the child notably has the duty:
>
> Toward themselves:
>
> – to remain in the family home and to leave it only with parental authorization;
>
> – to attend school at least until the age limit for compulsory education.
