| **✗** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Compulsory education

Mainland China’s laws mandate nine years of compulsory education for all
children, generally from age 6 to 15.

## Unschooling

According to UNESCO :

> Homeschooling is deemed to be illegal. The Compulsory Education Law states that compulsory education refers to attending a school which is certified by the government. The Notice of Working on the Enrollment of Primary and Secondary Schools 2019 states that parents or other legal guardians who do not send school-age children and adolescents to school for compulsory education without justifiable reasons shall be investigated for legal responsibilities in accordance with the law. However, the law does not apply to non-citizen children who hold foreign passports. Several sources indicate that home-schooling exists in China, especially among foreign families.

The Compulsory Education Law is written broadly – it states that children of the appropriate age, “regardless of sex, nationality, or race” shall attend school for the required years.
In principle, this could be interpreted to include foreign children living in China.
In practice, however, the law and its enforcement largely target Chinese citizens, and foreign passport–holding children are not forced into the state education system.
