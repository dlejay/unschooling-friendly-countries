# Unschooling in Hungary

## Compulsory education

Hungary mandates 13 years of education (from age 3 to 16) for every child.
Attendance in kindergarten is compulsory from age 3, and primary and secondary schooling is required until the age of 16 under the Act CXC of 2011 on National Public Education.

## Unschooling

Homeschooling (officially “individual learning plan”) is legal but highly restricted.
Parents must obtain prior authorization from the national Education Authority (Oktatási Hivatal).
Approval is generally granted only for exceptional reasons such as chronic illness, professional sports, or frequent travel.
All homeschooled children must remain enrolled in a school, follow the national curriculum, and pass mandatory examinations at least twice a year.
Informal unschooling or curriculum-free learning is not permitted: all education must adhere to the Hungarian national standards.
For foreign or expat families, the same compulsory education rules apply, and authorization is rarely granted without exceptional justification.
