## News

The Armenian government’s educational strategy emphasizes universal inclusive education – integrating all children, including those with disabilities, into mainstream schools as much as possible.

As of mid-2023, approximately 9,000 children with disabilities were recorded in
Armenian schools, showing that the vast majority are in school, not at home.

There are no known advocacy groups in Armenia that explicitly campaign for homeschooling freedoms.
