## Compulsory education

Argentina’s National Education Law establishes that education is compulsory from the age of 4 until the completion of secondary school.
This amounts to roughly 14 years of mandatory education (from pre-primary through high school).
Since Law 1420 of 1884, schooling in Argentina has been universal, free, secular, and obligatory in the primary years.

## Unschooling

According to the *LEY DE EDUCACIÓN NACIONAL* :

> Article 16: School enforcement across the country extends from the age of four (4) years to the completion of the level of secondary education.
> The Ministry of Education and the competent judicial authorities shall ensure compliance with the obligation of school through institutional,
> pedagogical and rights-promoting alternatives that meet the requirements of the local and community, urban and rural,
> by means of actions that allow to achieve results of equivalent quality throughout the country and in all social situations.

The only clearly defined home-based education in law is the ‘domiciliary and hospital education’ modality, intended for students who cannot attend school due to health or other exceptional reasons.
In those cases, the education system provides instruction at the child’s home or hospital to ensure continuity.
This modality is not the same as voluntary homeschooling by parents ; it is a state-supervised service to guarantee the right to education for sick or homebound children.

## Statistics

According to _Homeschooling Argentina_ – one of the largest networks of homeschooling families – as of early 2024 there were roughly 15,000 to 20,000 families across the country educating their children at home.

Around 1,500 students per year register in Buenos Aires City as free-exam
candidates to obtain an official certificate.

## News

The current president of Argentina Javier Milei said ‘afirmó estar en contra de la obligatoriedad de la educación’ on multiple occasions,
essentially questioning whether school attendance should be mandated by law.
