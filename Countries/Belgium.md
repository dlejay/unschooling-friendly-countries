## Compulsory education

Education in Belgium is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18.

## Unschooling

The Constitution of Belgium guarantees a “free choice” of education.
Most schooling laws depend on the Community level (either Flanders, French speaking or German speaking).

In all Communities, starting homeschooling in the middle of the school year requires prior authorisation (or is impossible)
and homeschoolers must pass national examinations or be forced to go to school.
