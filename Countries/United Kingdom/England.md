| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

| **✓** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Compulsory education

In England, education is compulsory for children from age 5 until 16.

## Unschooling

According to HSLDA

> But, surprisingly, unless a parent withdraws their child from a school where he or she is a registered pupil, there is no obligation to inform the local authority that the child is being educated at home.

> Parents are not required to follow the National Curriculum and there is no statutory obligation for local authorities to monitor the quality of home education on a routine basis.

## News

The UK government’s Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill (introduced in late 2024) includes major reforms for home education. It would establish compulsory
local registers of children not in school and give authorities new powers to
oversee and intervene in home education.

As of mid-2025, the Bill is still under debate (with amendments being discussed), but it is expected to pass in some form given government backing.
Once enacted, it will mark the biggest change in England’s home education law in decades, shifting from a largely laissez-faire approach to a more regulated framework focused on child welfare and educational quality.
