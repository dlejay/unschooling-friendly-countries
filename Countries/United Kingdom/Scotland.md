## Context

According to the Home education guidance :

> Under Section 35 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, parents of a child who has been
attending a public school4 must seek the local authority’s consent before withdrawing their
child from that school, and the authority must not unreasonably withhold consent.

and Section 35 of the Education Act reads :

> **Failure by parent to secure regular attendance by his child at a public school.**
>
> (1) Where a child of school age who has attended a public school on one or more occasions fails without reasonable excuse to attend regularly at the said school, then, unless the education authority have consented to the withdrawal of the child from the school (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), his parent shall be guilty of an offence against this section.
>
> (2) For the purposes of this section, a child who has been required to discontinue for any period his attendance at a school on account of his parent’s refusal or failure to comply with the rules, regulations or disciplinary requirements of the school, shall, unless the court otherwise determines, be deemed to have failed without reasonable excuse to attend regularly at the school.
