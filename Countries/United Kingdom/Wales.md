# Unschooling in Wales

| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✓** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✓** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Compulsory education

Wales has the same compulsory education age range as most of the UK.
Education is mandatory from age 5 up to 16.

## Unschooling

After years of debate and delay,  
the Welsh Government introduced statutory guidance on home education in May 2023.

This guidance reaffirms that parents are not required to follow the national curriculum  
and may educate using any philosophy, including unschooling, as long as the education is suitable.

However, local authorities are now expected to see and speak with home-educated children  
to assess the suitability of education and hear the child’s views.

In 2025, seven local authorities began piloting a Children Missing Education (CME) database.  
This allows councils to cross-check health records with school rolls to identify children not in education.  
Families educating at home, even those never registered in school, may be contacted by the local authority.

## Statistics

| Year    | Homeschooled children |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| 2023/24 | 6,156                 |
| 2022/23 | 5,330                 |
| 2021/22 | 4,681                 |

The numbers have more than doubled since 2018/19.  
The fastest growth is among 5-year-olds and teenagers aged 14–15.
