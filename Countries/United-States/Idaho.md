| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

According to CRHE,
> Idaho law exempts students being “privately instructed” from compulsory school attendance. Parents must provide instruction in “subjects commonly and usually taught in the public schools of Idaho.” There are no notification, parent qualification, instruction time, bookkeeping, or assessment requirements. 

## Context

In addition, CRHE also explains

>In 1963, the Idaho legislature passed a compulsory attendance statute that exempted children who were “otherwise comparably instructed, as may be determined by the board of trustees of the school district in which the child resides,” from compulsory school attendance. In Bayes v. State, decided in 1989, a homeschool father argued that the statute was overly vague. The court of appeals disagreed with him, pointing out that he had been given clear requirements to follow to demonstrate that the education he was providing his children was comparable. However, the statute continued to be disputed. In 1990, a local judge ruled in Welker v. Independent School District of Boise City No. 1 that homeschool parents have no obligation to provide information requested by the school district. That same year, the Idaho’s Fourth District Court found in In the Interest of Patterson that the school district had the burden to prove that a homeschool was not in compliance with the law, and that the burden did not shift to the homeschool parents to prove compliance.

> On April 8, 1992, the state legislature passed House Bill 502, which was introduced by Fred Tilman, a homeschooling father and state legislator. This bill revised the state’s compulsory attendance statute, exempting children who were “otherwise comparably instructed” and thus removing the board of trustees of the school district to determine whether this comparable instruction was taking place. On April 3, 2009, the governor signed Senate Bill 1017, revising the compulsory attendance statute to remove the word “comparably.” The statute now reads that a parent may meet the requirements of the compulsory attendance statute if they “cause the child to be privately instructed by, or at the direction of, his parent or guardian” and that this instruction must be provided “in subjects commonly and usually taught in the public schools of the state of Idaho.”
