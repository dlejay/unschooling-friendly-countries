# Unschooling in Louisiana

## Compulsory education

According to Louisiana Revised Statutes §17:221,
compulsory education applies from ages 5 to 18.

## Unschooling

According to CRHE :

> **Private school:** Parents may operate homeschools as private schools. Parents must submit an annual enrollment report to the state Louisiana Department of Education and are required to provide 180 days of instruction. There are no parent qualification, subject, bookkeeping, or assessment requirements.

> Parents may choose to classify their homeschools as “registered nonpublic schools” rather than as home study programs. State law requires that a school be “an institution for the teaching of children” that consists of “an adequate physical plant . . . instructional staff members, and students.” The Department of Education accepts operating as a private school as a valid homeschool option. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 17:236.
