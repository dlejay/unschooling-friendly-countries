## News

Texas has enacted a major school voucher law allowing families to receive up to $10,000 per student annually for private schooling, homeschooling, or virtual learning.
The program, launching in 2026–27, marks a massive expansion of public funding for alternatives to public school, with a $1 billion cap in its first year.
Homeschooling families stand to benefit significantly, gaining financial support to offset educational costs with few restrictions.
