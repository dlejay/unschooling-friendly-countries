## According to CRHE

> Instruction must be provided by a “competent teacher.” However, the state’s regulatory code governing homeschooling does not require any qualifications for either parents or those providing instructions. See N.Y. Educ. Law § 3204(2). In several custody cases where one parent wished to homeschool over the objection of the other, the New York courts have ordered children to attend public school when the parent wishing to homeschool had no experience teaching and could show “pedagogical competence to instruct children.”

> Parents must file an annual assessment at the same time that they file their fourth quarterly report. This assessment must be either “the results of a commercially published norm referenced achievement test” or “an alternative form of evaluation.” See N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8, § 100.10(h). Parents choosing a test must choose from a list of approved achievement tests, which must be administered at a school by professional staff or at a parent’s home or other location by a state certified teacher or “another qualified person” with the superintendent’s consent. A student’s score on a norm-referenced standardized test shall be deemed adequate if it is above the 33rd percentile or reflects one academic year of growth compared to a previous test. See N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8, § 100.10(h)(1). The alternative form of evaluation, which consists of a “written narrative,” may only be used for grades 1 through 3, and every other year during grades 4 through 8.
