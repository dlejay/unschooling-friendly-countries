# Unschooling in Missouri

## Compulsory education

According to Section 167.031, RSMo,

> **School attendance compulsory, who may be excused — nonattendance, penalty — home school, definition, requirements — school year defined — daily log, defense to prosecution — compulsory attendance age for the district defined. —** 1.  Every parent, guardian or other person in this state having charge, control or custody of a child not enrolled in a public, private, parochial, parish school or full-time equivalent attendance in a combination of such schools and between the ages of seven years and the compulsory attendance age for the district is responsible for enrolling the child in a program of academic instruction which complies with subsection 2 of this section. […]

## Homeschooling

According to CRHE

> **Homeschool statute:** Parents must provide required hours of instruction in reading, math, social studies, language arts, and science, must maintain basic academic records. There are no notification, parent qualification, or assessment requirements, and students’ academic records may only be inspected in case of legal investigation.

> Missouri’s homeschool statute was passed after a 1985 federal court decision, Ellis v. O’Hara. That decision found that the former law, which required homeschools to provide instruction “at least substantially equivalent” to that in public schools, “yields an unacceptable amount of discretion to officials charged with enforcement.” The court held the statute “unconstitutionally vague.”
