# Unschooling in Connecticut

| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✓** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✓** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## According to CRHE

> **Alternative instruction provision**: Connecticut law exempts children receiving instruction “elsewhere” from compulsory school attendance. Parents must offer “equivalent instruction in the studies taught in the public schools.” There are no notification, parent qualification, instruction time, bookkeeping, or assessment requirements.

> Connecticut’s compulsory education statute includes an exemption when parents are “able to show that the children are elsewhere receiving equivalent instructions in the studies taught in the public schools.” Connecticut has never passed a homeschool statute; from the earliest years of homeschooling to the present, parents have homeschooled under this “equivalent instruction” exemption. In 1982 the State Education Commissioner issued guidelines for school districts to follow when administering this exemption. New guidelines were issued in 1990, but neither set of rules ever had the force of law behind them, making them in effect voluntary. A 2002 bill to make the guidelines law failed to pass, as did a 2008 proposal.

## Further details

Even though parents must prove equivalent instruction, this is not enforced in any way.
As Education lawyer Thomas Mooney says:

> My view is that the state has abdicated its responsability

## News

In May 2025, over 2,000 people rallied at Connecticut’s Capitol to protest potential regulations on homeschooling, while state officials cited cases of abuse and educational neglect linked to unregulated homeschooling.

A report from the Office of the Child Advocate recommended oversight measures, noting that Connecticut is among the least regulated states for homeschooling.
The report says Connecticut is one of only 12 states with “**no meaningful regulation of homeschooling.**”
Republicans and advocates defended parental rights, arguing the focus should be on systemic failures in child protection, not homeschoolers.
