# Unschooling in West Virginia

## Compulsory education

According to W. Va. Code § 18-8-1

> **ARTICLE 8. COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE.
> §18-8-1a. Commencement and termination of compulsory school attendance; public
> school entrance requirements; exceptions.**
>
>  (a) Compulsory school attendance begins with the school year in which the sixth birthday
>  is reached prior to July 1 of such year or upon enrolling in a full-time publicly funded kindergarten
>  program, and continues to the 17th birthday or for as long as the student continues to be enrolled
>  in a school system after the 17th birthday.

## Homeschooling

According to the CRHE summary,

> West Virginia’s homeschool statute offers two options:
> 
> **Approval:** Parents must apply for the approval of the local school board, filing information and records as required. Parents must provide 180 days of instruction. The school board sets any teacher qualification, subject, and assessment requirements.
>
> **Notice:** Parents must provide one-time notice to the local superintendent. The parent providing instruction must have a high school diploma or equivalent and must have their children assessed annually (by standardized test or portfolio review) and submit this assessment after grades 3, 5, 8, and 11. There are no required hours of instruction, but parents are required to provide instruction in reading, language, mathematics, science, and social studies and must maintain copies of students’ assessment for three years. There is an intervention process for students not making acceptable progress.
