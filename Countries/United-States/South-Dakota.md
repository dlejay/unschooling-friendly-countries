# Unschooling in South Dakota

## Compulsory education

South Dakota mandates education for children from age 6 up to 18.

## Unschooling

According to the CRHE summary :

> **Alternative instruction provision:** South Dakota law exempts students receiving “alternative instruction” from compulsory school attendance. Parents must file an exemption certificate with the Department of Education or local school district. There are no parent qualifications, days of instruction, bookkeeping, or assessment requirements.

and 

> When the modern homeschool movement began in the 1970s and 1980s, South Dakota already had alternative education statutes on its books. Some homeschoolers, however, chafed against that statute’s home visit requirement. The state legislature removed this requirement when it passed H.B. 1260 in 1993. In 1996, the state legislature passed H.B. 1286, which allowed homeschool parents a greater degree of choice in selecting their children’s required nationally standardized achievement tests. South Dakota made significant changes to its homeschooling laws in 2021, when it removed all oversight and academic assessment requirements for homeschooled students.
