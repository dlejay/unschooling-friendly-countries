| ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✓** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✓** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Context

According to CRHE :

> **Homeschool statute:** Parents must provide “an organized educational program in the subject areas of reading, spelling, mathematics, science, history, civics, literature, writing, and English grammar.” There are no notification, parent qualification, instruction time, bookkeeping, or assessment requirements.

and

> Failure to educate is not included in the state’s definition of neglect, meaning that Michigan Child Protective Services does not have the authority to investigate educational neglect. If there is ever a question regarding whether a homeschooled child is being provided the required instruction, the state has the burden of proving that education is not taking place.
