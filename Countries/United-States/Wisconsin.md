|       |                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✓** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Context

According to the Homeschool Statute :

> **Section 118.165 Private Schools**
>
> **(1)(d)** The program provides a sequentially progressive curriculum of fundamental
> instruction in reading, language arts, mathematics, social studies, and science and health.
> This subsection does not require the program to include in its curriculum any concept,
> topic, or practice in conflict with the program’s religious doctrines or to exclude from its
> curriculum any concept, topic, or practice consistent with the program’s religious
> doctrines.

According to CRHE :

> Wisconsin law does not give either the Department of Public Instruction or local education agencies the authority to monitor home-based private educational programs to ensure that they are meeting the requirements outlined here. However, should a complaint be lodged, the local superintendent may ask the homeschool parents or guardians to provide evidence of their compliance with the law.
