# Unschooling in Oregon

## Unschooling

Under Oregon Revised Statutes § 339.035, homeschooling families are not required to follow a state-mandated curriculum.
However, children must demonstrate educational progress through standardized testing at specific grade levels (3, 5, 8, and 10).
These assessments must be selected from tests approved by the State Board of Education and administered by a qualified neutral person.
