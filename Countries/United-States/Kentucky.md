# Unschooling in Kentucky

## Compulsory education

Education is compulsory between ages 6 and 18.

## Unschooling

According to the Homeschool Requirements of the Kentucky DoE,

> ✓ Establish a bonafide school for the children to attend. When informing the district superintendent
of your desire to homeschool, create a ‘school’ name. This will be used for future records and
diplomas.

> ✓ Record and maintain scholarship reports of each student's progress in all subjects taught at the
> same intervals as the local public schools. See KRS 159.040. KDE suggests that the person
> responsible for instruction keep a portfolio that contains samples of the best work done by each
> child in several areas of study and maintain the portfolio each year the student is homeschooled.
> This may be of assistance in documenting the existence of the homeschool or the transfer of the
> child to another educational setting. A record of courses taken and grades received is also
> necessary.

> ✓ It is required that all core instruction be offered in the English language.
