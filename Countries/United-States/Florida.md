# Unschooling in Florida

## Compulsory education

According to Florida Statute §1003.21,

- Children who are 6 years old by February 1 of a school year must attend regularly.
- Students must continue attendance until age 16 (or older if they have not graduated and have not filed a formal declaration to terminate enrollment).
- Compulsory education requirements may be satisfied through a home education program.

## Unschooling

Unschooling is lawful in Florida under the home education program framework established by Florida Statute §1002.41.

Under §1002.41, legal obligations are limited to:
- Submitting a written notice of intent to establish a home education program to the county school superintendent.
- Maintaining a portfolio of records documenting educational activities and materials.
- Providing an annual educational evaluation demonstrating educational progress, using one of the statutory evaluation methods.

### Statutory evaluation methods

Florida Statute §1002.41(1)(f) provides:

> “The parent shall provide for an annual educational evaluation in which is documented the student’s demonstration of educational progress at a level commensurate with her or his ability.  
> The parent shall select the method of evaluation and shall file a copy of the evaluation annually with the district school superintendent’s office in the county in which the student resides.  
> The annual educational evaluation shall consist of one of the following:
>
> 1. A teacher selected by the parent shall evaluate the student’s educational progress upon review of the portfolio and discussion with the student. Such teacher shall hold a valid regular Florida certificate to teach academic subjects at the elementary or secondary level;
> 2. The student shall take any nationally normed student achievement test administered by a certified teacher;
> 3. The student shall take a state student assessment test used by the school district and administered by a certified teacher, at a location and under testing conditions approved by the school district;
