# Unschooling in Oklahoma

## Compulsory education

Oklahoma’s compulsory education law covers ages 5 through 18.

## Unschooling

According to CRHE

> **Alternative instruction provision:** Oklahoma law exempts students for whom “other means of education are provided” from compulsory school attendance. Parents must provide 180 days of instruction, but there are no notification, parent qualification, subject, bookkeeping, or assessment requirements.

and

> A court case in 1957 placed the burden of proving that “no other means of education was provided” upon the state. See Sheppard v. Oklahoma, 306 P.2d 346 (Okla. Crim. App. 1957). An Attorney General opinion in 1973 clarified that parents could educate their children at home “so long as the private instruction is supplied in good faith and is equivalent in fact to that afforded by the state.” See Okla. Att’y Gen. Op. No. 73-129 (Feb. 13, 1973). This equivalence is not required by law and has never been asserted by a decision of the courts.
