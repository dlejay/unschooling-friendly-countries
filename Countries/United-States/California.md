## Context

California has four homeschool options.

- Private school
- Private school satellite program
- Private tutor
- Independent study program

### Private school

Under §48222 of the California Education Code :

> Children who are being instructed in a private full-time day school by persons capable of teaching shall be exempted. Such school shall, except under the circumstances described in Section 30, **be taught in the English language** and shall offer instruction in the several branches of study required to be taught in the public schools of the state. The attendance of the pupils shall be kept by private school authorities in a register, and the record of attendance shall indicate clearly every absence of the pupil from school for a half day or more during each day that school is maintained during the year.

### Private school satellite program (PSP)

By enrolling in a PSP, a child is considered a private school student under California Education Code §48222.

### Private tutor

Under §48224 of the California Education Code :

> Children not attending a private, full-time, day school and who are being instructed in study and recitation for at least three hours a day for 175 days each calendar year by a private tutor or other person in the several branches of study required to be taught in the public schools of this state and in the English language shall be exempted. The tutor or other person **shall hold a valid state credential for the grade taught.** The instruction shall be offered between the hours of 8 o'clock a.m. and 4 o'clock p.m.

§48222 also applies.

### Independent study

Independent study is a public school alternative to traditional classroom-based education, authorized under California Education Code Sections 51745–51749.3.
Unlike the previous, which fall under private school law, independent study is a public school option, typically offered through public school districts or county offices of education, including charter schools.
