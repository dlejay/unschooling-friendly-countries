# Unschooling in Delaware

## Compulsory education

Delaware requires school attendance for ages 5 through 16.
This obligation may be satisfied via public school, private school, or a registered homeschool (nonpublic school).

## Unschooling

In Delaware, homeschools are legally classified as nonpublic schools.

According to the Delaware Code,

> **§ 2704. Report of non-public schools to Department.**
> (a) All persons conducting nonpublic schools shall report end of the year attendance information to the Department of Education annually, on or before the July 31, on such forms as shall be prescribed by the Department of Education.
> 
> (b) Such persons shall also submit annually, no later than September 30, a statement of pupil enrollment on such forms as prescribed by the Department of Education.
