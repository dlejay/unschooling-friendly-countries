# Unschooling in Ohio

## Compulsory education

According to OH Rev Code § 3321.01 (2025)

> A child between six and eighteen years of age is "of compulsory school age" for the purpose of sections 3321.01 to 3321.13 of the Revised Code. A child under six years of age who has been enrolled in kindergarten also shall be considered "of compulsory school age" for the purpose of sections 3321.01 to 3321.13 of the Revised Code unless at any time the child's parent or guardian, at the parent's or guardian's discretion and in consultation with the child's teacher and principal, formally withdraws the child from kindergarten. The compulsory school age of a child shall not commence until the beginning of the term of such schools, or other time in the school year fixed by the rules of the board of the district in which the child resides.

## Homeschooling

According to the CRHE summary,

> **Homeschool statute:** Parents must submit annual notification to the local superintendent, including basic identifying information and provide the same number of instructional hours as required by the public school district. There are no bookkeeping requirements, required assessments, nor parental qualifications. 
>
> **Private school:** A homeschool may operate as an “08 school” if there is a religious objection to government oversight and the parent providing instruction has a bachelor’s degree. Parents must provide annual notice to the Ohio Department of Education, keep attendance records, and provide 182 days of instruction in a variety of subjects. There is no assessment requirement.
