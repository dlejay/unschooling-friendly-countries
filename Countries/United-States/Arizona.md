# Unschooling in Arizona

## Legal framework

According to the Revised Statute 15-802:

> C. An affidavit of intent shall be filed within thirty days from the time the child begins to attend a private school or homeschool and is not required thereafter unless the private school or the homeschool instruction is terminated and then resumed.  The person who has custody of the child shall notify the county school superintendent within thirty days of the termination that the child is no longer being instructed at a private school or a homeschool.  If the private school or homeschool instruction is resumed, the person who has custody of the child shall file another affidavit of intent with the county school superintendent within thirty days.

As CRHE summarizes it :

> **Homeschool statute**: Parents must submit one-time notification to the local school district and must provide instruction in reading, grammar, math, social studies, and science. There are no parent qualification, hours of instruction, bookkeeping, or assessment requirements.
