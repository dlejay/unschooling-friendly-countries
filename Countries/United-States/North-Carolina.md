# Unschooling in North Carolina

According to CRHE :

> **Homeschool statute:** Parents must file a one-time form with the Department of Non-Public Instruction, have their children tested annually, and keep attendance records, immunization records, and test scores on file. Parents providing instruction must have a high school diploma or its equivalent and operate their homeschools “on a regular schedule” for nine months each year. There are no subject requirements or minimum test scores, and while parents are required to make test scores available for inspection in their homes, they are not required to submit them and the Department of Non-Public Instruction does not currently inspect homeschool records.
