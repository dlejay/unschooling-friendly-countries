# Unschooling in Kansas

## Court casses

Re Sawyer, 672 P.2d 1093 (Kan. 1983) is explicitly hostile towards unschooling :

> At issue is whether there is substantial competent evidence to support the trial court’s finding the home instruction by Mrs. Sawyer is not a school within the meaning of K.S.A. 72-1111. Viewing the State’s evidence and the testimony of Bonnie Sawyer and Dr. Bean in the light most favorable to the State, as we must in these cases, we have no hesitation in concluding the evidence supports the trial court’s finding. Longview School, Inc., is the Sawyer home. It is unaccredited. The only students are Matthew and Anna Sawyer. Bonnie Sawyer is the teacher. She is uncertified with no teaching experience. She combines the babysitting of two smaller children with her attempt to teach Matthew and Anna. There is no testing, planning or scheduling. The only goal of the arrangement is to extricate Matthew from his failure in public school. Anna is a pawn in the struggle. This will not suffice. We find the Sawyers’ plan, though well intentioned, a thinly veiled subterfuge attacking compulsory school attendance. If such a family arrangement will serve as a substitute for school, there is no compulsory school attendance. Clearly the legislature intends to maintain compulsory education. We find appellants’ argument is without merit.
