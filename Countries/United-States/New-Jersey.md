# Unschooling in New Jersey

## Compulsory education

Education is compulsory from 6 to 16.

## Unschooling

According to the FAQs :

> N.J.S.A. 18A:38-25 requires that “every parent, guardian or other person having custody and control of a child between six and 16 to ensure that such child regularly attends the public schools of the district or a day school in which there is given instruction equivalent to that provided in the public schools for children of similar grades and attainments or to receive equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school.”

> There are two major court decisions in New Jersey relative to homeschooling:
>
> State v. Vaughn 44 N.J. 142 (1965): This case deals with the procedures to be employed when a parent/guardian is charged with failing to cause the child to attend school under the compulsory education law.  During the prosecution of a case against a parent/guardian for a violation of the compulsory education law, the State needed only to allege a violation of the statute.  It was then incumbent upon the parent/guardian to introduce evidence showing that they are relying on one of the two statutory exceptions (day school or equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school).  Once there is such evidence in the case, the burden of persuasion with respect to whether the education comes within the exception is with the State.
> 
> State v. Massa 95 N.J. Super 382 (1967): In court, the parents were charged with failing to cause the child to attend school under the compulsory education law.  The only issue before the court was whether the parents were providing equivalent instruction.  The court held that the language under the compulsory education law, providing for equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school, required showing only academic equivalency and not equivalency of social development derived from group education.  In educating the child at home, the parents were required to show only that “the instruction was academically equivalent to that provided in the local public school.”
