## Compulsory education

School attendance is mandatory in the U.S. Virgin Islands from age 5
(kindergarten) until the school year of a student’s 18th birthday.

## Context

The Virgin Islands Code (Title 17, §84) empowers the VI Board of Education to
set rules for “home instruction” of children who have official permission to
remain out of a traditional school for that purpose.

According to the Home Education Policy :

> **Section 84-3 Application Review and Approval**
>
> (a) The Commissioner of Education shall appoint a designee who will receive, review, and forward Approved/Disapproved Notices of Intent for Home Education to the Virgin Islands Board of Education, the Superintendant of Schools, the Division of Curriculum and Instruction, and the parent/guardian.
>
> (b) The Commissioner shall notify the parent/guardian of approval/disapproval of the Notice of Intent for Home Education no later than 15 calendar days after the receipt of the Notice of Intent. A copy of the Home Education Policy should be enclosed with the response. A letter of explanation shall be enclosed if there is cause to disapprove an intent document.
>
> […]
>
> **Section 84-7 Home Education Plan Curriculum**
>
> The home education program shall include but not be limited to the following subjects :
>
> (a) Primary level education : Reading, language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and electives.
>
> (b) Secondary level education : English, mathematics, science, Virgin Islands culture & history, physical education, foreing language & digital literacy

Foreign and expat families residing in the USVI have the same options for
education as local families.
