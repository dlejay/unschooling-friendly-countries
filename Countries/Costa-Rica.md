## Compulsory education

By law, preschool, primary and secondary levels are all obligatory.
In practice this means roughly **11 years of schooling**:
two years of pre-primary (ages ~3–4), six years of primary (Grades 1–6, ages ~6–11),
and three years of secondary (Grades 7–9, ages ~12–14).
Children must be enrolled from age six up to about age 15 under the _Código de la Niñez y la Adolescencia_
and the Education Law (_Ley Fundamental de Educación_).

## Unschooling

According to Article 59 of the _CÓDIGO DE LA NIÑEZ Y LA ADOLESCENCIA_,

> Preschool education, basic general education and diversified education will be free, compulsory and paid for by the State.

## News

In October 2024 a new bill (Expediente 24.648) was introduced in the Legislative Assembly to formally legalize
and regulate home and distance education.
That proposed law would amend the Education Code to allow parents to educate their children at home
(‘homeschooling’) under MEP supervision.
For example, Article 2 of the draft law explicitly adds ‘homeschooling’ to the list of non‑classroom modalities permitted,
provided it is always ‘under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Education’.
Similarly, the bill’s explanatory text emphasizes that families could have greater flexibility while still ensuring national quality standards.
As of mid-2025 the proposal is pending committee review.
