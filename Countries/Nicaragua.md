# Unschooling in Nicaragua

## Compulsory education

Schooling from about age 6 until age 12 is required.
The U.S. Department of Labor noted that ‘the country’s laws do not establish a clear compulsory education age’
and highlighted a gap where children aged 12 to 14 are not required to be in school (under current practice) but also are too young to work.

## Unschooling

According to the _LEY GENERAL DE EDUCACIÓN_:

> VIII
>
> That access to education is free and equal for all Nicaraguans. Primary education is free and compulsory in state schools.

Nevertheless, OLASE notes :

> Homeschooling is uncommon among nationals. The Nicaraguan Constitution (1987) and the education law, Ley General de Educacion No. 582 (2006), govern education and do not specify compulsory school attendance. Although the Constitution states in Article 121 that “basic education is…compulsory,” practical experience suggests that there is little enforcement of basic education in the form of school attendance. The compulsory education age is from 7-14.

## News

Nicaragua’s stance on homeschooling as of 2025 is one of non-recognition but also limited interference.
