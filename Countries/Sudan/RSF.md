# Unschooling in Sudan – RSF controlled areas

## Unschooling

In RSF-controlled areas, State education systems have collapsed.
Schools are closed, damaged, or inactive, and no functioning educational authority remains.
As a result, families rely on home-based and community-based learning.
Homeschooling has become widespread by necessity, and unschooling is effectively unrestricted due to the absence of regulation.
