# Unschooling in Sudan – SAF controlled areas

## Compulsory education

According to the Interim Constitution :

> **13. Education, Science, Art and Culture**
>
> **1**
>
> **a** The State shall promote education at all levels all over the Sudan and shall ensure free and compulsory education at the primary level and in illiteracy eradication programmes.
>
> **b** Every person or group of persons shall have the right to establish and maintain private schools and other educational institutions at all levels in accordance with the conditions and standards provided by law.

## Unschooling

According to the EUAA Country of Origin Information Report on Sudan (2024/2025), the SAF-backed “Popular Resistance” has established “Pride and Dignity” training camps that target youth and students.
While officially voluntary, reports indicate a coercive environment where non-participation carries the risk of social exclusion, loss of employment, or accusations of treason, effectively creating a system of compulsory military schooling for the region’s youth.
