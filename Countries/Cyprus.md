| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no authorization               |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum free                  |

## Compulsory education

With the 2024 amendment, the starting age is being lowered to 4, so that compulsory education will span from age 4 to 15 once fully implemented.

## Unschooling

Homeschooling in Cyprus is only allowed in exceptional cases.
Parents can apply to the Ministry of Education, Sports and Youth for permission in such special cases, and even then the child must be taught by a Ministry-approved teacher following the national curriculum

Expatriates and foreign nationals residing in Cyprus are subject to the same compulsory education laws as Cypriot citizens.
All children living in Cyprus between the ages of 5 (now gradually 4) and 15 are expected to be enrolled in a recognized school.
Notably, families where either the child or a parent has Cypriot nationality have no legal option to homeschool – the children must attend school by law.
Some sources suggested in the past that if neither parent nor child is Cypriot, authorities might tolerate home education in certain cases.
In principle, foreign residents can apply for permission to homeschool, providing a detailed curriculum aligned with national standards.
In practice, however, even expatriate families have faced enforcement of the school-attendance requirement.
There are reports of expat families being forced by authorities to enroll their children in school or leave the country when they attempted to homeschool without approval.

## News

In March 2024, the House of Representatives passed an amendment to the education law to lower the starting age of compulsory education to 4 years old.
