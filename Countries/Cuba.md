| **✗** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

In Cuba, education is mandatory between age 6 and 15-16.

## Context

Homeschooling is illegal in Cuba. The Cuban Constitution states in its Article 39b that :

> education is a function of the State, and free of charge.
> It is based on the conclusions and contributions of science, and on the closest relationship between study and life, work, and production.

## News

Since 2023, Cuba has maintained its strict prohibition on homeschooling, reinforcing state control over education. Despite deteriorating conditions in public schools—marked by teacher shortages, blackouts, and infrastructure issues—families are legally compelled to enroll their children in government-run institutions. Notably, Pastor Ramón Rigal and his wife, previously imprisoned for homeschooling, were re-arrested in April 2025, highlighting the regime’s continued crackdown on educational dissent.
