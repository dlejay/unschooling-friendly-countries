# Unschooling in India

## Context

In 2009, India passed the Right To Education Act, which according to the Departement of School Education & Literacy,

> clarifies that ‘compulsory education’ means obligation of the appropriate government to provide free elementary education and ensure compulsory admission, attendance and completion of elementary education to every child in the six to fourteen age group. ‘Free’ means that no child shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education.

According to HSLDA :

> Homeschoolers had a feeling that RTE Act infringed on their freedom to choose the mode of education. As a result, homeschoolers demanded amendment of the act in order to accommodate homeschooling as a one of the approved modes of education. In response to the agitation of the homeschooling parents, the HRD minister, Mr. Kapil Sibbal, clarified the ministry’s position on homeschooling in an interview with Times of India in late 2010, “The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 wants every child to be in school, but if somebody decides not to send his/her children to school, we are not going to interfere. The compulsion is on the state, not on the parents. Parents are free not to send their children to school but teach them at home. We cannot be micromanaging.”

> The only hope is the badly written RTE Act itself. While it says every child between six and fourteen years of age must attend school and outlines consequences for schools that refuse to admit children, there is no consequence stated for a parent who refuses to send their child to school. And there is one more hope. Our poor implementation of laws.

According to Krystelle Dsouza,

> In the year 2023-2024, the Education Ministry discovered that more than 72,000 students were getting a home-based education, with Tamil Nadu leading the practice.

In 2023, the report on the National Credit Network says homeschooling, online learning and alternative learning should be validated, and students given certificates & diplomas for them.
