## Context

Homeschooling remains a legal option in Italy, protected under the Constitution's provisions regarding
the right and duty of parents to educate their children (Art. 30) and the freedom of teaching (Art. 33).

Article 23 of the _DECRETO LEGISLATIVO n. 62_ states :

> In the case of parental education,
> the parents of the pupil or student,
> or those who exercise parental responsibility,
> are required to submit annually the prior notification
> to the school head of the territory of residence.
> Such pupils or students shall take annually the examination of
> eligibility for passage to the next class
> as external candidates at a state school or equal,
> until the completion of compulsory education.

In 2023, the “Decreto Caivano” (resulting in Law 159/2023) further enforces compulsory education
obligations by establishing fines for non compliance.

New ministerial procedures now require a project outline (“_progetto
didattico-educativo_”) to be sent by families
each year along with the annual notice.
