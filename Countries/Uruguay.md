# Unschooling in Uruguay

## Context

According to the _Ley General de Educación_ :

> Article 7 (Compulsory nature): Initial education is compulsory for children four and five years of age, primary education and basic and
> higher secondary education. To such effects, the extension of the pedagogical time and the curricular activity to the students of primary
> and middle basic education will be assured.
> 
> Parents or legal guardians of children and adolescents are obliged to enroll them in an educational center and observe their attendance and learning.

In 2020, Article 7 got amended to:

> Initial education from four years of age, primary education and secondary education is mandatory. Parents, or legal guardians of children and adolescents, as well as students of legal age, have the duty to contribute to the fulfillment of this obligation, in accordance with the provisions of the first paragraph of article 70 of the Constitution of the Republic and the provisions of this law.

however, homeschooling is not legally recognised and authorities interpret compulsory education as requiring attendance at a recognised educational institution.

In 2024, the Uruguayan education authorities (ANEP) took legal action against a Mennonite community from the US which was homeschooling eleven children.
The case became public in July 2024 after CODICEN referred the matter to the courts; in March 2025 a first-instance ruling did not find a violation of children's rights, and ANEP appealed the decision.
