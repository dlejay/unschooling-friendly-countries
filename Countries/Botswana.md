| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Compulsory education

In Botswana, children must receive ten years of basic education, with no
specific ages mandated.

## Unschooling

Homeschooling is explicitly legal in Botswana and is acknowledged by the education system as a valid educational pathway.
There is no overarching law that mandates parents to enroll their children in formal institutional schools, thus allowing for home-based education.
Several sources describe Botswana as offering one of Africa's most favorable environments for families choosing to homeschool, largely due to this lack of prohibitive legislation.

## Statistics

According to schoolhouseteachers.com, 3 % of the children in Botswana are homeschooled.
