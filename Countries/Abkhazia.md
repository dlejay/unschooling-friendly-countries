# Unschooling in Abkhazia
| | |
|-|-|
| __✓__ | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| __✓__ | It requires no prior authorisation |
| __✓__ | It can be curriculum-free |

## Context

According to the Family Code of the Republic of Abkazia :

> Parents, taking into account the opinion of their children, have the right to choose an educational institution and the form of education for their children. 

Homeschooling seems to be unregulated in Abkazia, as noted by Thomas Hammarberg and Magdalena Grono in 2017 :

> The new Ombudsperson
> explained that home schooling for disabled children is not regulated;

A Spunik article in 2022 talks about including homeschooling in Abkhaze law similarly to what currently exists in the Russian law.
