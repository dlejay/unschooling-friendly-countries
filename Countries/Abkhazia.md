# Unschooling in Abkhazia

## Context

According to the Family Code of the Republic of Abkazia :

> Parents, taking into account the opinion of their children, have the right to choose an educational institution and the form of education for their children.

Homeschooling seems to be unregulated in Abkazia, as noted by Thomas Hammarberg and Magdalena Grono in 2017 :

> The new Ombudsperson
> explained that home schooling for disabled children is not regulated;

A Spunik article in 2022 talks about including homeschooling in Abkhaze law similarly to what currently exists in the Russian law.

Evidence strongly suggests that homeschooling is a practiced reality within Abkhazia, particularly among the ethnic Georgian community residing in the Gali region, as
explained by the Georgian journalist Lana Kokaia in 2022.

> Back In Gali, however, families either homeschool to provide children with
> knowledge of their native language, or face sending them away to study.
