# Unschooling in Kuwait

## Compulsory education

Kuwait mandates nine years of free education (primary plus intermediate levels) for its citizens.

## Unschooling

According to HSLDA :

> Homeschooling is not specifically addressed in Kuwaiti law. The constitution in Art. 40 states: “[e]ducation in its preliminary stages shall be compulsory.” Families interpret this to support their decision to homeschool, since education, not school attendance, is compulsory. There is a growing movement among families to have homeschooling officially recognized and integrated into the educational framework of Kuwait.
