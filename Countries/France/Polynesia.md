# Unschooling in French Polynesia

## Compulsory education

Education is compulsory from age 3 up to 16 years old.

## Unschooling

Home instruction is allowed but only in specific cases.
Parents wishing to homeschool must declare each year to the
Ministry of Education (DGEE) and the municipal mayor,
and obtain prior approval.
The _Loi du Pays n°2017-15_ specifies that homeschooling must be justified
by specific reasons – for example, medical needs, disability
(awaiting specialized schooling), high-level sports or arts training,
itinerant parents, or significant geographic isolation.

It applies to all residents.
