# Unschooling in New Caledonia

## Context

New Caledonia follows the older version of French law on homeschooling.
According to the 2016 deliberation,

> Article 2-1: In accordance with the provisions of the Organic Law, children subject to compulsory education who receive it from their families are identified by the competent services of the provinces in the case of primary school pupils and by the competent services of New Caledonia in the case of secondary school pupils.
> 
> Article 2-2: These children are, from the first year, and every two years, the subject of an investigation by the competent services of New Caledonia in order to establish the reasons alleged by the persons responsible and whether they are given an education compatible with their state of health and the family's living conditions. This control makes it possible to verify in particular that the education provided in the same home is for the children of a single family, and to ensure the acquisition of the basic knowledge and skills. It is carried out without delay in the event of failure to declare instruction by the family, without prejudice to the application of penal sanctions.
> The results of this control are notified to the persons responsible with an indication of the time limit within which they will have to provide their explanations or improve the situation and of the sanctions to which they will be subject if they do not. If, at the end of a new deadline set by the competent administrative service of New Caledonia, the results of the control are deemed insufficient, the parents are given formal notice, within fifteen days of the notification, to enrol their child in the educational establishment designated by the authority invested with the power to assign pupils.
