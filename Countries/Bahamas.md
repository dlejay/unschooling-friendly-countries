## Compulsory education

The Education Act requires parents of every child 5 to 16 years old (the compulsory education age) to ensure the child receives a suitable full-time education “by regular attendance at school or otherwise”.

## Unschooling

According to the Ministry of Education :

> Section 24 (1) of the Education Act, recognizes both the responsibility and the rights of parents:
> “It shall be the duty of the parents of every child of compulsory school age to cause him to receive full-time education suitable to his age,
> ability and aptitude, by regular attendance at school or otherwise”.
> Home Schooling, as a mode of education delivery, falls under the category of “otherwise”.

The official registration form of the Ministry of Education has a checkbox “unschooling”.

## Statistics

In early 2021, the Minister of Education reported that over 2,000 students had
been registered for homeschooling over the previous four years.
