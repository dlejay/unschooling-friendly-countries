| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Compulsory education

By law school attendance is compulsory from age 5 through age 15.

## Status of unschooling

According to the Education Act :

> (3) An educational plan for each student who is receiving home education shall be prepared and provided
> to the Chief Education Officer subject to the following conditions—
>
> (a) the initial educational plan shall be prepared and provided to the Chief Education Officer 3 months prior to the commencement
> of the home education programme;
>
> (b) the educational plan shall be for a minimum period of 3 school years and shall cover every year of the home education programme;
>
> (c) the educational plan shall include a description of the learning activities for the student that will comply with the goals
> and objectives set out in section 3(3); and
>
> (d) the educational plan shall be based on the national curriculum as established by the Minister under Part 8.

Any parent or guardian residing in Saint Lucia – whether citizen or foreign national – who wishes to homeschool must comply with the same rules.

## Trend

In late 2023 and early 2024 the government undertook a major revision of the Education Act,
including specific provisions for homeschooling.
A draft of the new Education Bill and Regulations was published on 17 May 2024.
This proposed law greatly expands the rules for home education.
For example, parents must now formally apply in writing at least three months before starting homeschooling.
The application must include a three-year curriculum plan (meeting national standards) and teacher qualifications. Once approved, homeschooling permission lasts one year and must be renewed annually.
The CEO keeps a public register of all approved homeschooled children and may grant the child access to
public-school resources if needed.
Parents are required to submit an annual progress report by June 30.
The CEO may also demand standardized academic assessments (with 14 days’ notice and a prescribed fee),
and can advise or intervene if a child is not making satisfactory progress.
