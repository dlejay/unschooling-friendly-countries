## Unschooling

According to UNESCO :

> According to the 2010 Law No. 544 and the 2011 Law No. 211, (Ch. 3), homeschooling or home education is regulated under non-state education law. Home-schooling is available to all Libyan students based upon the condition that at least one family member has an educational or university qualification. Parents who wish to register their child as a home-schooled student must do so at their respected school district. Home-schooling students will have to take a final year assessment with a state school in their district to qualify them to move to the following year.

The law applies to all children residing in the country.
