# Unschooling in Yemen – Houthi-controlled areas

## Compulsory education

Houthi-controlled areas still follow Yemen’s General Education Law, which mandates :

> Article **(18)**: Basic education is a unified general education for all pupils in the Republic, lasting (9) years.
> It is compulsory, and pupils are accepted from the age of six.

## Unschooling

According to the UN report

> 152. Children who avoid summer courses risk being denied primary or high school
> diplomas, while participants receive such benefits as free university education.
> Families that refuse to enlist their children are often denied essential supplies, such
> as food baskets and cooking gas. Local tribal or neighbourhood leaders, a
> foundational layer in the recruitment system, maintain strict oversight to enforce these
> measures. The Zaynabiyat pressure mothers to support recruitment in exchange for
> educational or financial incentives. Cultural events, zawamil (traditional Yemeni
> chant) and visual propaganda glorify jihad and martyrdom.
