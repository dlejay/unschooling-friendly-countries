# Unschooling in Yemen – IRG-controlled areas (Aden-based government)

## Compulsory education

The internationally recognised government (IRG), based in Aden, explicitly applies the national Education Law, which reads :

> Article **(18)**: Basic education is a unified general education for all pupils in the Republic, lasting (9) years.
> It is compulsory, and pupils are accepted from the age of six.

## Unschooling

Despite the legal text, there is currently zero effective enforcement of compulsory education laws in IRG-controlled areas.
