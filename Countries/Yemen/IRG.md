# Unschooling in Yemen – IRG-controlled areas (Aden-based government)

## Compulsory education

The internationally recognised government (IRG), based in Aden, explicitly applies the **national Education Law**, which guarantees **nine years of compulsory, free basic education from age 6 to 15** (grades 1–9).

Official education sector plans and strategies issued by the Ministry of Education in Aden reaffirm:

- the 9-year compulsory basic cycle,
- the state obligation to provide free schooling during this period,
- and the objective of universal enrolment in grades 1–9.

On paper, this is **compulsory education**, understood as **compulsory schooling**.

## Homeschooling and unschooling

Under the IRG’s legal framework:

- **There is no explicit recognition of homeschooling** as an alternative to school.
- No statute, regulation or policy describes procedures for registering homeschooled children.
- There is **no mechanism to approve parent-led or curriculum-free education** as satisfying compulsory basic education.

Families are expected to use public or recognized private schools. Unschooling therefore has **no legal status** under IRG law. Any home-based education happens outside the law and depends on the absence of enforcement.

## Practice and enforcement

Because of war, displacement and poverty:

- A large proportion of children in IRG-held areas are still **out of school**, despite the legal obligation.
- Authorities and international partners focus on **reopening and supporting schools**, not on prosecuting parents.
- Attendance rules are **weakly enforced**; non-attendance is common but treated as a social problem, not a criminal one.

This creates a de facto space where families may keep children at home, but **without legal protection** and with uncertain recognition for exams or later schooling.

## Expatriate and foreign families

For expatriate families living in IRG-controlled areas:

- There is no specific law on homeschooling foreign children.
- Many families use **international schools or online programmes**.
- Certificates and diplomas generally need to be stamped or recognized by the **Aden-based Ministry of Education** if they are to be used within Yemen (for example, to enter university).

None of this amounts to a **right to homeschool**; it is simply practical flexibility in a fragmented system.
