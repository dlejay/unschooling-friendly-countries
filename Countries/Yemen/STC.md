## Compulsory education

The Southern Transitional Council (STC) exercises de factor control over Aden and parts of southern Yemen but has not adopted its own education law.
The national Education Law thus applies :

> Article **(18)**: Basic education is a unified general education for all pupils in the Republic, lasting (9) years.
> It is compulsory, and pupils are accepted from the age of six.

## Unschooling

In practice, compulsory education is not enforced in STC-controlled areas.
Administrative capacity is weak, schools are frequently disrupted, and families educating at home face no monitoring, no sanctions, and no formal recognition.
