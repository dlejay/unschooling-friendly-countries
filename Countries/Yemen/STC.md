# Unschooling in Yemen – Southern Transitional Council (STC) areas

## Compulsory education

The Southern Transitional Council (STC) controls Aden and parts of southern Yemen but has **not adopted its own education law**. In practice, schools in STC-held areas:

- still operate within the framework of the national Education Law (nine years of compulsory basic education, ages 6–15),
- and use curricula and examinations linked to the Aden-based Ministry of Education.

The STC exercises **de facto authority over local administration and security**, but compulsory education remains defined by the inherited national law, not by a new STC statute. Schooling is expected, but enforcement is weak.

## Homeschooling and unschooling

The STC has not published any law or regulation that:

- recognises homeschooling or home education,
- creates a procedure for registering homeschooled children,
- or authorises curriculum-free education as satisfying compulsory education.

Education policy in STC-controlled areas is dominated by **school-based provision**, with some ideological and symbolic differences (flag, anthem, political messaging), but **no legal opening for homeschooling**. Unschooling exists, if at all, only informally and without protection.

## Practice and enforcement

On the ground:

- The STC and allied local authorities support the reopening and functioning of schools in Aden and neighbouring governorates.
- International agencies work with the **Aden Education Office** and local authorities to refurbish schools, supply materials and keep children in classrooms.
- Attendance is **irregular**, and many children remain out of school due to poverty and insecurity, but this stems from structural problems rather than a policy choice to allow homeschooling.

There is **no enforcement regime focused on parents who keep children at home**, but there is also **no recognition** of unschooling as fulfilling compulsory education.

## Expatriate and foreign families

Foreign families in STC-influenced areas face the same basic situation as in IRG-held territory:

- No specific homeschooling rules.
- Practical reliance on private schools, international curricula or online schooling.
- For any education path that needs recognition inside Yemen, certificates usually have to be validated by the **Aden-based Ministry of Education**, not by the STC.
