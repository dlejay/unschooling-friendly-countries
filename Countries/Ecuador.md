| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✓** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✓** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Compulsory education

Ecuador requires 15 years of compulsory education:

- 1 year of initial education (pre-school, age ~4–5)
- 10 years of Educación General Básica (primary + lower secondary, ages ~5–15)
- 3 years of Bachillerato (upper secondary, ages ~15–18)

## Unschooling

With 2023 _Acuerdo Ministerial_ parents no longer need qualifications or need
to ask for permission to homeschool.

If a child does not take or pass the national exams, they remain legally outside the formal system and cannot receive certified diplomas.
The 2023 regulation does not impose penalties for this, but it leaves the student without official recognition of their studies.
