| **✗** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Unschooling

According to Art 63.2 of the Constitution :

> The family is responsible for the education of its members and has the right to choose the type of education of their minor children.

Also, according to Art 4g) of the *Ley General de Educación* :

> The family, primarily responsible for the education of its children, has the duty and the right to educate them.
> It is free to decide the type and form of education it wishes for its children;

Despite the above rights, Dominican law mandates formal schooling for all
children from age 6 to 14 (the ‘_nivel básico_’ covering primary education).

Dominican education officials view ‘_educación en casa_’ (homeschooling) as a red flag, and families openly claiming to homeschool could face scrutiny.

## News

In 2023, homeschooling gained significant attention at the policy level.
On May 17, 2023, Deputy Elías Wessin Chávez (of the PQDC party) introduced a bill in the Chamber of Deputies to formally incorporate ‘_educación en casa_’ (homeschooling) into the national education system.
