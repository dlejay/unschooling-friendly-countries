## Compulsory education

The Education Basic Law mandates 12 years of compulsory schooling.

## Unschooling

Homeschooling is not allowed in Turkey. Per the *National Education Basic Law* :

> ARTICLE 3 – Compulsory primary education includes children in the age group of 6-13.
> This age begins at the end of September of the year in which the child turns 5,
> and ends at the end of the academic year of the year in which he turns 13 and turns 14.
>
> ARTICLE 7 – Primary Education; It is a National Education and Training Institution,
> consisting of a four-year compulsory primary school and a four-year compulsory secondary school,
> established to achieve the purpose specified in Article 1.

The situation is quite different for foreign residents (expatriates) living in Turkey, who have more leeway to homeschool.
Foreign nationals residing in Turkey are not legally obliged to enroll their children in Turkish schools if they prefer not to. In fact, expatriate families do not even need to notify the Ministry of Education if their children are studying at home or enrolled in an overseas distance-learning program

## News

In line with Turkey’s long-standing ‘unity of education’ principle, officials and experts have continued to view homeschooling skeptically, suggesting it does not align with national education objectives under current law.

Homeschooling carries a largely negative public perception, and media stories often underline the risks over the rewards.
