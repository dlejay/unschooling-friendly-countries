## Compulsory education

Education is compulsory for all children aged 5 through 18.

## Unschooling

The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico states :

> Section 5. Every person has the right to an education which shall be directed to the full development of the human personality
> and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
> There shall be a system of free and wholly non-sectarian public education.
> Instruction in the elementary and secondary schools shall be free and shall be compulsory in the elementary schools to the extent permitted
> by the facilities of the state.
> No public property or public funds shall be used for the support of schools or educational institutions other than those of the state.
> Nothing contained in this provision shall prevent the state from furnishing to any child non-educational services established by law
> for the protection or welfare of children.
>
> Compulsory attendance at elementary public schools to the extent permitted by the facilities of the state as herein provided
> shall not be construed as applicable to those who receive elementary education in schools established under non-governmental auspices.

Parents choose their own curriculum and teaching approach (there is no state-prescribed homeschool curriculum).
No periodic testing or formal reporting is mandated while homeschooling ;
DEPR imposes oversight only if the family returns the child to public school.
