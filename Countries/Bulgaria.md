| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no prior authorisation         |

## Context

In Bulgaria, education is mandatory for all children between the age of 4 and 16.

### Law

Before 2015 homeschooling was illegal in Bulgaria.

Then with the Pre-school and School Education Act,

> The education “at home” was allowed under the **independent form
> of education.** This format is subject to oversight by the educational system
> controlling bodies and the students have to be enrolled in a formal school, which
> allows this format.

as explained by Gerana Skarski.

Some sections of the Pre-school and School Education Act :

> Article 12. (1) Each citizen shall exercise the right to education in
> accordance with his or her preferences and abilities at a kindergarten or a
> school of his or her choice, unless this Act and the related secondary
> legislation rule otherwise.
>
> (2) The choice under paragraph 1 for minors under the age of 14
> shall be made for them and on their behalf by their parents, and the
> choice for minors between 14 and 18 years of age shall be made by the
> pupils with their parents' consent.
>
> […]
>
> Article 112.
> (3) The bespoke form of instruction shall include self-studies and
> exams to give the annual mark in the relevant subject from the school
> syllabus.
>
> (4) The school syllabus for the day or evening form of instruction
> shall apply to the bespoke form of instruction.

We'll abbreviate ‘Samostoyatelna Forma na Obuchenie’ (Independent form of
education) with СФО

### Approval process

Initiating СФО requires submitting an application to the director of the chosen school,
often accompanied by supporting documents (e.g., medical documentation for health reasons, or a declaration of suitable conditions).
The final decision rests with state education authorities, typically an expert committee at the relevant Regional Education Department (РУО),
which assesses the application.
Historically, the precise criteria for assessing the suitability of the home learning environment were noted as being somewhat vague,
though parents are required to declare that such an environment exists.

### Assesment

Knowledge acquisition is rigorously monitored. Students in СФО are subject to regular examinations
(often held annually or biannually across different subjects) administered by their enrolled school.
These exams are designed to validate the student's understanding against the state curriculum standards.
Failure to meet these standards can result in the educational commission mandating a return to regular, daily school attendance.
Schools maintain specific procedures and schedules for these exams.

## News

Since 2023, pre-school education is now mandatory in Bulgaria from age 4.
This reform was adopted in 2020.

In parallel, Bulgarian legislation has tightened sanctions against uncontrolled alternatives to the official system.
Organizing an unregistered educational structure (e.g., a clandestine kindergarten or an unauthorized ‘school’ association) is subject to a heavy fine.
The law imposes a penalty of 5,000 to 10,000 leva (approximately €2,500 to €5,000) for anyone illegally organizing the education of children aged 3 until mandatory school age,
with the intent to issue an unrecognized educational document.
This measure particularly targets parent cooperatives for early childhood, which authorities aim to discourage if they are not state-approved.

In terms of media coverage, homeschooling in Bulgaria has been the subject of a few positive reports, highlighting its growth.
For example, the town of Bansko (a mountain resort) was showcased in early 2024 as an attractive hub for international families practicing
worldschooling and remote work, due to its quality of life and the presence of community micro-schools tailored to children educated outside the traditional system.
This phenomenon remains marginal but reflects the increasing visibility of homeschooling in Bulgaria’s globalized society.
