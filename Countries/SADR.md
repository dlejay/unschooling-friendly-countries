# Unschooling in SADR

## Compulsory education

Education in the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic is free and compulsory under Article 36 of the Constitution, which mandates that the State “shall ensure compulsory and free education and organise the educational institutions in line with the educational legislation”.

In practice, schooling is the only accepted form of fulfilling this duty.
Basic education lasts about nine to ten years, covering primary and lower-secondary levels.
Children generally start school at age 6 and must continue through around age 15 – 16.

The Ministry of Education reaffirmed in 2025 that education in the SADR remains “free, compulsory, and bilingual” (Arabic and Spanish).

## Unschooling

There is no legal framework for homeschooling or parent-led education.
All Sahrawi children are expected to attend public schools, most of which operate in the refugee camps administered by the SADR.

Homeschooling is therefore not legally recognised nor permitted for Sahrawi citizens.

However, foreign families residing temporarily in SADR-administered areas are not subject to compulsory-attendance enforcement and may educate their children privately or online.
