## News

Attorney General Kiryowa Kiwanuka gave a definitive statement on the legal status of homeschooling.
He clarified that under the current law, “Homeschooling technically is illegal.
The law requires you to take the child to school”.

Following the Attorney General’s pronouncement, the government issued a public warning to parents about engaging in homeschooling.
On November 20, 2024, Kiwanuka (the AG) told the Parliament’s Education Committee and the media that any parent or guardian choosing to homeschool was acting outside the law.
He reiterated, “It is illegal. The law requires you to take the child to school… if you are teaching [children], you must be qualified as a teacher”.

Based on the study’s findings and rising interest, the Ministry of Education through NCDC has started work on a Home Schooling Policy blueprint.
In July 2024, the Daily Monitor reported that “parents will soon be able to decide whether to enroll their children at school or teach them at home, if a government blueprint in the works gets wings to fly”.
This policy is still in early stages, but officials have confirmed several components under discussion.
According to the Ministry spokesperson, Dr. Denis Mugimba, the NCDC is using the study findings to draft a customized curriculum and framework for homeschoolers.
