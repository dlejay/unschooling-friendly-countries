>
> Section 27. (2020/52) General
>
> Home schooling means that the guardian is responsible for ensuring that a child whose place of residence is in Åland, according to the Home Municipality Act, fulfills their obligation to learn according to Section 1 in Part III. The guardian is responsible for ensuring that the child acquires the knowledge and skills specified in the primary school curriculum.
>
> Section 28. (2020/52) Notification
>
> The guardians must notify the home municipality in writing every school year that the compulsory education is fulfilled through home education. The notification must be accompanied by a plan of how the guardian will arrange the teaching so that the entire teaching obligation is fulfilled. When changing the municipality of residence, the guardian must provide the new municipality with the most recent statement in accordance with section 29, subsection 1. in Part III on the child's development and progress in relation to the curriculum.

According to Yle, the exodus of homeschooling families from Sweden to Åland had
the island register

> 132 homeschooled children, compared to 11 in 2012.

and the local situation has evolved.

> Åland's move to harmonise homeschooled kids has led some families to move away. Four families told Yle that the stepped-up supervision was why they left.

> In 2021, Åland revised its homeschooling rules, allowing authorities to remove children from learning at home if they were found not to be making sufficient progress.
