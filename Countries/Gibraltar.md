## Compulsory education

Under current law, education is compulsory from age 4 up to the 16th birthday.

## Unschooling

According to the Education and Training Act :

> 50. Subject to the provisions of section 73 it shall be the duty of the parent of every child of compulsory school age residing in Gibraltar,
>     to cause him to receive efficient full-time education which, in the opinion of the Director,
>     is suitable to his age, ability and aptitude,
>     either by regular attendance at school or otherwise.

## News

**Education and Training (Amendment) Act 2023 (No.19/2023)** – This law raised the compulsory school age to 16, meaning all children from age 4 up to but not including their 16th birthday must be educated. It redefined the stages of schooling (primary = ages 4–11; secondary = 11–16).
Crucially, it revised Section 50 of the Act so that parents must secure ‘suitable education’ for their child, taking into account any special needs,
either by regular school attendance or otherwise (i.e. by home education)
