encompassing six years of primary and four years of ordinary secondary
education.

## News

The recent policy changes (2023/24) have extended the de facto compulsory period
to 10 years, encompassing six years of primary and four years of ordinary
secondary education.
In other words, once fully implemented, Tanzanian children will be required to attend an accredited school (public or private) from around age 7 up to about age 16.
Zanzibar, which has its own education law, similarly mandates basic education (the specifics may differ slightly, but any child of primary-school age in Zanzibar also must attend school by law).

Because homeschooling (for non-disabled children) operates in a legal grey area, there is no dedicated enforcement mechanism specific to it.
However, Tanzania’s compulsory attendance laws mean that parents could potentially face consequences if authorities deem them to be keeping
a child out of school without valid excuse.
In practice, enforcement of school attendance has focused on truancy
and on preventing children from being kept home for reasons like disability stigma or child labor.
The 2024 announcement about prosecuting parents who hide disabled children is one example of stronger enforcement.
