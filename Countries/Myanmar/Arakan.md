# Unschooling in Myanmar – Arakan

## Compulsory education

According to dmediag.com :

> Schools in Arakan State are said to lack a clear and concise education policy. They also need policies to work step by step, and guidelines that are relevant to the ground. It is not known whether policies have been formulated on compulsory primary education, education for the poor, education support, and education development plans for five and 10 years.
