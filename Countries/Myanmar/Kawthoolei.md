# Unschooling in Myanmar – Kawthoolei (areas under KNU control)

According to Paskorn Jumlongrach :

> At present, students in Karen State are required to attend a compulsory education up to Grade 12, an equivalent of Mathayom Six in Thailand’s education. Formerly, students were required to attend class up to 800-1,200 hours. But since the wars have raged on, it was made flexible for them to attend 75% of the time or 800 hours. As to the extension of education beyond Grade 12, seven educational institutions in various areas offer the diploma education and are managed by KNU. Some students study the curriculum offered by local universities that provide special curriculum to train teachers, particularly in border area.
