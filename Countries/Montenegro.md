## Compulsory education

Basic education in Montenegro is compulsory and lasts 9 years.

## Context

The law continues to permit homeschooling only as a limited exception to regular schooling.
Article 3 of the Primary Education Law allows a parent or guardian to organize a child’s education
at home for up to one semester or one school year, as an exception to the rule that education is delivered in schools.

The Ministry of Education’s Rulebook on the manner and procedure of knowledge
assessment for students educated at home (Pravilnik) – issued in 2015 – also
remains in effect, detailing how homeschooled children are evaluated.

Parents must notify the school in which their child is enrolled in writing at
least 2 months before beginning home education.

The child must follow the national curriculum for their grade.
The law mandates that a homeschooled student “must attain the required knowledge standards in accordance with the educational program”.

The school is obligated to organize assessment of the student’s knowledge in all
subjects of the given grade at the end of each semester or school year.
