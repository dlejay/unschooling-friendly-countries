# Unschooling in Slovenia

## Compulsory education

In Slovenia, basic education is compulsory for nine years.

## Unschooling

The Primary Education Act states :

> **Article 88**
>
> **(The right to education at home)**
>
> [...]
> Parents must notify in writing the primary school in which the child is enrolled no later than 16 August of the current school year for the following school year that the child will be educated at home.
> The right to home education cannot be exercised during the school year.
> Parents must notify the primary school in writing for each school year separately.
> [...]

> **Article 90**
>
> **(Assessment of knowledge)**
>
> For a pupil who is educated at home, knowledge is assessed in all subjects according to the curriculum of the respective grade of the officially recognised primary-school programme in which the pupil is enrolled.
>
> A pupil educated at home must take part in the knowledge assessments prescribed by this Act and its implementing regulations. The assessments are carried out by the primary school in which the pupil is enrolled, and the pupil’s knowledge is evaluated by an examination board.
>
> If a pupil educated at home does not achieve the minimum standards of knowledge or receives a failing grade in any subject, the pupil has the right to a re-assessment before the start of the next school year.
>
> If the pupil does not pass this re-assessment, the pupil must in the following school year continue primary-school education in a public or private primary school as referred to in the first or second indent of Article 5 of this Act. In that case, the parents may no longer exercise the right to home education for the pupil in subsequent grades.

The Primary Education Act makes no special exception for children of foreign nationals.
