## Compulsory education

Haiti’s constitution guarantees the right to education and declares that _l’enseignement fondamental est obligatoire_ (fundamental education is obligatory).
In practice, this corresponds to primary schooling.
Elementary education is commonly described as compulsory for children roughly between ages 6 and 11.

## Context

According to the Constitution :

> ARTICLE 32.3:
>
> Primary education is compulsory under penalty of sanctions to be determined by law.

UNESCO notes that :

> There seems to be no regulation regarding homeschooling

## Statistics

Approximately 50% of primary-school-age children are not enrolled in school, and
60% of students drop out before finishing 6th grade.
