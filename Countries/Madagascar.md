Under the 2023 law, children begin one mandatory year of preschool at age 5, then proceed through nine years of primary and lower-secondary education.

## Unschooling

According to UNESCO :

> No information was found in official documents. However, it seems that home schooling is possible.
> For example, it is possible to register as an independent candidate in the regional examination centers, notably the French high school in Tananarive, for all DNB and baccalaureate exams.
> Only the regional examination centers can register these exams with the French system in Madagascar.
