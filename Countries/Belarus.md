| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Compulsory education

Schooling is mandatory for 11 years (age 6 through 17).
The law mandates that by age 19 every citizen must have finished
secondary education.

## Unschooling

Under the Education Code (as amended), children may be taught at home only if they are temporarily or permanently unable to attend school for medical reasons.

The rules apply to any children resident in Belarus, regardless of nationality.

## News

The most notable change is a tightening of the 2022 Codeʼs wording via a law
(adopted end-2024, in force Sept 2025) banning any foreign-based or online schooling for Belarus-resident children.
Education officials explain that from 1 September 2025 all children living in Belarus must receive general secondary education only in Belarusian schools
