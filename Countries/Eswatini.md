## Compulsory education

Primary education (Grades 1–7, roughly ages 6–12) is compulsory in Eswatini,
as established by the Free Primary Education Act of 2010 and the national constitution.

## Unschooling

According to The Free Primary Education Act :

> _Offences_
>
> 10. (1) A parent of a child to whom this Act applies who neglects or refuses to cause the child to attend school, unless the child is excused under section 11, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine
>     not exceeding E1,000 or in default of which, to three months commutiny services.
>     Foreign nationals residing in Eswatini are subject to the same education laws.

## News

In 2023 it was suggested that the government raise the compulsory schooling age to 15 (to match the minimum employment age) and legally guarantee 9 years of free basic education.
