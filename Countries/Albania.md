| **✗** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |

## Compulsory education

Mandatory schooling span is 9 years.

## Unschooling

In Albania, homeschooling is only possible in exceptional cases.
The Law on Pre-university Education states :

> Article 17
>
> Education in home conditions
> Home education is offered in special cases, for all classes of basic education or only for some of them.
> The Minister defines special cases, criteria and procedures for education in home conditions.

Official ministry guidelines (the 2013 Normative Dispositions for schools) envisage home tutoring primarily for students who cannot attend school due to disability or long-term absence.

There are no special homeschooling rules for expatriates.
