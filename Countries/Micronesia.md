# Unschooling in Micronesia

## Compulsory education

FSM law mandates 8 years of elementary education.
Under Title 40 ยง104, all children must be educated from first grade through eighth grade (or age 14).
The 2023 amendment extended this to include kindergarten as the first grade of
elementary school.

## Unschooling

According to FSM law,

> ยง 111. Certification of home learning programs.
> The Secretary of Education and the State Boards of Education may set minimum standards for home learning.
>
> (1) The Secretary and the State Boards of Education may, upon application, review and approve a course of study of home learning as meeting those minimum standards.
>
> (2) The Secretary and State Board of Education shall monitor for compliance with the minimum standards established by the Secretary, any home study programs which are approved under this section, and may revoke its own approval, giving reasonable grounds for such action.
