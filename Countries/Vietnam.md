# Unschooling in Vietnam

## Compulsory education

By law, all children must complete 9 years of basic education.

## Unschooling

According to UNESCO :

> The Law on Education (2019) states that all citizens must complete compulsory education, and guardians are responsible for creating the conditions for family members of a certain age to study (Article 14). However, the Law on Education does not specify that homeschooling is forbidden. Further, unofficial sources indicate that homeschooling exists in Viet Nam.

Vietnam’s laws do not exempt expatriate children from the general education
requirements.
