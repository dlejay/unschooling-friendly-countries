| **✓** | Homeschooling is a legal form of schooling |
| **✗** | It requires no prior authorisation         |
| **✗** | It can be curriculum-free                  |

## Compulsory education

Under current law primary education (Tahun 1–6) is compulsory (six years).
Secondary education beyond Year 6 is not yet mandated by law, but the government is moving to change this.

## Unschooling

According to the Education Act of 1996 (Act 550),

> Compulsory primary education
>
> 29A. (1) The Minister may, by order published in the Gazette,
> prescribe primary education to be compulsory education.
>
> (2) Every parent who is a Malaysian citizen residing in Malaysia shall ensure that if his child has attained
> the age of six years on the first day of January of the current school year that child is enrolled as a pupil in a primary school
> in that year and remains a pupil in a primary school for the duration of the compulsory education.

In practice, all Malaysian parents must enrol their six-year-olds in Year 1 and
ensure they complete Years 1–6.

Officially, homeschooling is legal but tightly regulated. It is treated as an exemption from the compulsory-education requirement. Under the Education Act and MOE guidelines, parents must apply for permission to homeschool their child. Applications (_borang_) are submitted to the State Education Department (JPN), reviewed by the Director-General, and finally decided by the Minister.

## Statistics

## News

There have been no new laws specifically easing homeschooling – the existing rules remain in force. Instead, government focus since 2023 has been on expanding compulsory education. Notably:

1. Aug 2023 : KPM announced it was finalizing a policy to make schooling mandatory up to SPM.
2. Nov 2023 : In Parliament, the Education Minister said a draft Education Act amendment to extend compulsory schooling from 6 to 11 years was prepared.
3. Sept 2024 : The Minister warned that legal enforcement (penalties under the new 11-year policy) would be used if needed to prevent dropouts.
4. Mar 2025 : Education (Amendment) Bill 2025 was reported to include a clause holding parents accountable for ensuring their children finish both primary and secondary school

Aside from these, no official announcements have loosened or expanded homeschooling provisions.
The MOE still views home-based education as a privilege for special cases.
