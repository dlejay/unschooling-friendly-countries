## Compulsory educatino

## Unschooling

According to the *Schulpflichtgesetz* :

> § 11. (1) Notwithstanding § 12, general compulsory education can also be fulfilled by attending classes at a private school without public status (_Öffentlichkeitsrecht_),
> provided that the classes are at least equivalent to those at a school named in § 5.
>
> (2) Compulsory schooling can also be fulfilled by attending home tuition (_häuslicher Unterricht_),
> provided that the tuition is at least equivalent to that at a school named in § 5 — with the exception of the polytechnic school (_Polytechnische Schule_).
>
> (2a) Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply to pupils who are required to attend a German support class (_Deutschförderklasse_) pursuant to § 8h para.
> 2 or a German support course (_Deutschförderkurs_) pursuant to § 8h para. 3 of the School Organisation Act (_Schulorganisationsgesetz_).
> These pupils must fulfil their general compulsory education requirement for as long as they need one of these special language support measures in public schools
> or in schools with _Öffentlichkeitsrecht_ that have a legally regulated school designation.
>
> (3) The parents or other legal guardians must notify the _Bildungsdirektion_ within one week after the end of the previous school year that their child is taking part
> in instruction mentioned in paragraph 1 or 2. The notification must include :
>
> - the first and last names, date of birth, and address of the person who will be primarily responsible for instructing the child ;
> - the location where the instruction will take place :
> - the annual report card for the previous school year or a certificate of the external examination for the previous grade level ;
> - the curriculum to be followed and the grade level at which instruction will take place ; and
> - a summary of the pedagogical concept for the instruction.

The law applies to all Austrian residents.

## News

Since 2023, Austria has enacted significant legislative changes that have reshaped the practice of _häuslicher Unterricht_.
The notification process now demands that parents submit their intent to homeschool within one week of the end of the previous school year,
accompanied by precise details : the name of the primary instructor, the location of instruction, and a _pädagogisches Konzept_ outlining educational goals and methods.
A mandatory _Reflexionsgespräch_ has been introduced, requiring a mid-year meeting with school authorities to assess the child’s progress ;
failure to attend results in an immediate prohibition of homeschooling.
Additionally, Externistenprüfungen have been centralized, with families assigned to specific schools by the _Bildungsdirektion_ to ensure consistent standards.
These reforms reflect Austria’s move towards stricter regulation and closer monitoring of homeschooling to safeguard educational equivalence.
