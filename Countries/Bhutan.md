# Unschooling in Bhutan

## Compulsory education

Bhutan’s legal framework distinguishes between “free” and “compulsory” education.
The Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan mandates that the State must provide
free education to all children of school-going age up to the tenth standard.
This provision covers 11 years of education, from Pre-Primary (PP) through Grade X.   

However, Bhutan is one of the few nations in the world that does not have a compulsory education law that legally mandates parents to enroll their children in a school.
The constitutional duty is on the state to provide access, not on the citizen to attend.
