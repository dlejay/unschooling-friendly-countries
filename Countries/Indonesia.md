# Unschooling in Indonesia

## Compulsory education

In Indonesia, the state mandates 9 years of free compulsory education (6 years primary + 3 years lower secondary)
for ages approximately 7 to 15.

## Unschooling

According to the Education Act :

> **Part Two**
> 
> **Rights and Obligations of Parents**
> 
> **Article 7**
> 
> (1) Parents shall have the right to take part in the choice of the unit of education for their children and to obtain information concerning circumstance of their children’s education.
> 
> (2) Parents of the children entitled to receive compulsory education shall have the obligation to ensure basic education for their children.

And according to HSLDA :

> In May 2007 the Department of Education published a manual detailing the requirements for homeschooling. The manual asks homeschools to register and requires testing at certain levels, but currently there is no enforcement of these requirements. Homeschoolers are not automatically awarded high school diplomas, so entrance into university may be difficult.
