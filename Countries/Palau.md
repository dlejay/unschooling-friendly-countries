To implement this provision, the Ministry shall provide compulsory education. The Board, in consultation with the Ministers of Education and Health, shall adopt health, safety and educational quality standards for all preschool and kindergarten education programs. The standards shall be adopted no later than June 1997. Thereafter the Ministries of Education and Health, and the Bureau of Public Works, shall conduct periodic inspections to ensure continuing compliance with the standards.

Any parent, guardian, or other person who permits a child who is under his control to be absent from school without good cause and in violation of applicable law or regulations shall be guilty of a violation of this section and, upon conviction, shall be fined not more than $100.

The same law applies to all residents.
