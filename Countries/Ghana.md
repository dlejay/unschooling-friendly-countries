# Unschooling in Ghana

## Compulsory education

Basic education (ages roughly 4–15) is compulsory : two years of kindergarten plus six years of primary and three years of junior high.

## Context

According to HSLDA :

> Homeschooling is growing in Ghana. According to the Constitution of the Republic of Ghana (1992):
>
> (1) All persons shall have the right to equal educational opportunities and facilities. With a view to achieving the full realization of that right,
> 
> (a) basic education shall be free, compulsory and available to all.
>
> (1) Parliament shall enact such laws as are necessary to ensure that:
> 
> (c) parents undertake their natural right and obligation of care, maintenance and upbringing of their children in co-operation with such institutions as Parliament may, by law, prescribe in such manner that in all cases the interest of the children are paramount;
>
> (4) no child shall be deprived by any other person of medical treatment, education or any other social or economic benefit by reason only of religious or other beliefs.
>
> In Section 17, the Education Act of 1961 establishes regulations on private institutions that must first have prior approval from the Minister of Education. Failure to notify within three months of establishment could result in fines and up to one year imprisonment.
